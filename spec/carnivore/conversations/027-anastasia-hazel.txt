Good morning, what happens when your weight stalls and you not losing ? Do you fast to kickstart it ?

Fasting helps, resistance training and cardio will help as well, some people can lose weight without exercise and some have to, I have to do both to get the scale moving, you can try Omad Carnivore(not easy).

Keep pushing! I stayed at the same weight for two weeks and then dropped 5 lbs the week after. Just stay the course and keep going.

If you are eating cheese or any kind of dairy stop eating it until things start moving forward again
