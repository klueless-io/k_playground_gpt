Dot Stroop
Sorry for the long post‚Ä¶.I need help 
I don‚Äôt know what to do‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve been carnivore for over 6 months, yes I have slipped up when I not in control due to going out for a meal, I try my best, to the point I either say ‚ÄúI‚Äôve eaten or I‚Äôm not hungry ‚Äú 
Most days I start with green tea. Water (with adding salt)
For lunch I will have pork scotch fillet steak or beef mince/steak with westgold butter. I‚Äôm also having bacon and eggs 
For dinner I tend not to have anything or if I‚Äôm hungry I will have a small beef patty 
I‚ÄôM NOT LOSING WEIGHT 
MY INFLAMMATION IS GETTING WORSE (to the point I‚Äôm thinking of getting a cortisone injection into my ankle) I HAVE GOT ARTHRITIS IN MY ANKLE 
I work full time in childcare care ( just had a 6 week break)
I joined a gym and go swimming 6 days (after work) 
I‚Äôm 65
2 years ago I was going keto with huge salads for lunch filled with vegetables, nuts, seeds,protein and oils lots heaps of weight, felt great able to move lots and had a clear mind. I was able to fast doing OMAD fasting up to 36/48 hours I was able with the help of bone broth to do a 5 day fast..
I tried to go back to having salads but my arthritis flared up so much that I couldn‚Äôt walk
I don‚Äôt know what to do 
Currently I‚Äôm sticking to 
green tea and water 
Steak, mince beef
Pork scotch fillet 
If anyone knows of a GP if S.A. I would like to make a time to see a professional 
Also if someone has any advice please share 
Thanks for taking time to read my post

I would suggest you stop eating pork. Try just beef and see if it makes a difference. also if I eat egg whites my back hurts so I only eat yolks. trial and error.

I'm wondering if you are possibly under-eating, YES, under-eating. You are exercising a lot and not refuelling which can place the. body under stress so we tend to hold on to weight as a survival mechanism, plus, I'd stop the green tea (heavy in oxalates).

Kim Fitt I agree maybe under eating.... I struggle with this aswell.. coming from a diet mentality when I'm not losing weight I try to cut my meals/calories.... it's hard to change ur mindset though.

Andie James I did the same too, plus you get full very quickly and you don't feel like eating for a long time which can work against us

If you buying the beef patties look on the ingredients, im yet to find any that haven't used seed oils.
Even the grass fed patties from woollies uses seed oils flours and even preservatives..‚Ä¶ See more

Cut back to just beef, salt and water. See if it improves.

I ditched the pork, chicken, coffee and cream from my diet, and Just eat beef, lamb, wild caught fish, pasture raised eggs, grass fed butter, Pink Salt, and drink boiled and filtered water or bottled water. Pain free, starting to drop the kgs and feeling great

I have bad knees and ankles. I even ended up with plantar fasciitis. Very painful. I'm sure I have arthritis starting but not diagnosed yet. I started taking magnesium that has helped so much. I also wear one of these on my worst ankle which also helps.

Dot Stroop maybe that is the reason for your struggles. Food is the secondary timekeeper in the body and if you don‚Äôt adhere to it‚Äôs circadian based functions. Problems will arise.

I would try the lion diet and up the fat and definitely include electrolytes as others have mentioned. I would also stick to red meats (beef and lamb), over white meat (chicken, pork). The only thing I would include other than the red meat is salmon an‚Ä¶ See more

Oh and I‚Äôve heard along my own research journey that cheats are worse than we think. So you may go out for dinner once in a while and ‚Äúslip up‚Äù but apparently it can take up to 6 weeks for your body to actually get back to a baseline state of ketosis. ‚Ä¶ See more

This may not be appropriate but why not go back to keto if that‚Äôs what you were eating when you left good?

The green tea would be full of oxalates. Maybe get rid of that.

You may want to research more about oxalate dumping. Eillot Overton has video on this topic that I believe they're helpful to you:

One of the original carnivores, Kelly Hogan (13+ years) runs a group and is finding that post-menupause, alot women need much higher fat intake, like 80/20 fat/protein. I think it was this video where she discussed it:
