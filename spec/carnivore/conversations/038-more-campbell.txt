Week 10.......to be honest, today.....I am not loving meat üòí. I don't want to eat anything else.....I don't really want to eat anything. Just forced myself to eat chicken soup.....chicken only. Also feeling a bit achey, inflammation seems to have come back. Trusting the process.

Probably oxalate dumping. But only eat if you‚Äôre hungry. No need to force yourself.

If you trust the process, don't force yourself to eat. Your body will let you know when it is hungry

Ashley Smith - Nuell why??? Twice a month or something. Not good for you. Vitamins and minerals are important.

Ashley Smith - Nuell I do a weekly fast as well. Dr Thomas Seyfried determined in his research if Americans will fast 7 days 2 times a year half of the cancer hospitals will go out of business. It is very good for us for sure.

Perfect time to be fasting! At the other hand, you don‚Äôt have to eat meat every day. I can go with chaffles and butter or farmers cheese with sour cream for entire day

The addiction is being broken. It is amazing when you can finally get to the point where food is fuel instead of entertainment. There is more to life.
I am now to one meal a day with light snack. The obsession will break eventually and you can get bac‚Ä¶ See more

The chicken causes inflammation in my body.
Sometimes you have to figure out what meats you react to better. I do best with ruminant animals.
The not being hungry is the thing I love most about being carnivore

Maybe do the egg fast? It's a 3-5 day fast. It might help you get focus back.

If you're not hungry, don't force yourself to eat! I'm always trying to gain mass/size, I got pretty decent through force feeding but eventually it's just not worth it, now I won't force feed at all, if the hunger isn't there it's not there, and when it is then I'll eat.

Keto flu. It passes. Chicken does not have enough fat. Try to up your protein intake and your fat intake so you can get adapted . New people should not fast. This is after your adapted, authpothy. Self eating. Some folks just like to st‚Ä¶ See more

I'm sure it's been several times, but it's true... only eat when you are hungry. Trust the process means also trusting your body.

Just fast a day. Eat tomorrow. Sometimes body just doesnt want food and wants to clean up, regenerate. Listen to it and eat only when you feel hungry

Sounds like you may be transitioning into ketosis. Google symptoms and if that is it congrats.

Lisa Campbell drink some bone broth and electrolytes. I make my own electrolytes from salt and lemon in soda water. The soda water seems to settle my stomach.
I have been turned off pork. I just want a steak.‚Ä¶ See more
