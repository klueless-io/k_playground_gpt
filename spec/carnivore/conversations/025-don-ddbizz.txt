I did carnivore for 2 months. Couldn't handle it. Didn't lose weight and didn't feel any different. Keto is much better. Some days I still find myself eating carnivore. So I just change it up

I'm 64, hubby is 65. I am doing this woe, trying to convince him to. He does support my efforts, though, and does not try to undermine me. I lost 10 lbs 1st month, then cut out dairy. My weakness is variety but if you look, you can find carnivore recipes.
