Hello my husband and I would like to begin this diet but I am breastfeeding our 6 month old and intend to do so until she weans.

You need more electrolytes and fat but it's doable. When I started I noticed a dip in supply while starting but it came back up quickly. There's a carnival motherhood group that was helpful for me.

Eat more meat more frequently to satisfy appetite. Drink more water.
