I’m 8 days into this and just did my weigh-in. I gained a pound. Is that a normal thing to happen? Wasn’t expecting that.

You'll lose inches throughout whole body as time passes before you see real numbers on the scale, put it up for 90 days , watch inches .

Yep, that's how my body rolls too. I have heard of someone gaining 20lbs during the first 6 months and then she dropped maybe 100 after that? I'm thankful that hasn't happened to me because I would have trouble trusting the process.

Losing or gaining weight should be a tragectory not necessarily a consistency.

Pound of water? Muscle? Bone density? Stomach contents? Intestines contents?
You may have a whoosh in a few days

Yeah you're still too early and your body is still adapting. Honestly the weight will take time. Don't force on it. Focus on improving your diet and doing fasts

I keep losing and gaining the same 4 pounds. But I can tell I’m losing because my face and hands are slimmer

You are going to gain muscle! We all know muscle weighs more than fat. So you can put on 5 Lbs of muscle, and lose 4 lbs of fat. You’ll look better, feel better, and then get on the scale and think you gained a Lb. It’s ok to gain LBs. look at inche… See more

Eight days isn’t a long time. Your body may be adjusting to the new way of eating. Give it a little more time before you assess.

Try again either daily, or once weekly. Track the trend. Your body can go up and down 3 to 4 lbs a day depending on water retention.

My husband and I seem to be losing more inches than weight. We are in our 3rd week, we have lost weight, but the inches are definitely where we are losing them most. Hey, I'll take it.

Jose M Matos this could be the reason. Muscle weighs more than fat. Also, do you really need to shed fat? Are you actually overweight? Also, in case you took "before measurements", check if you lost inches.
