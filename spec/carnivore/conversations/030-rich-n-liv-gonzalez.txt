Eggs. Bacon. Meatballs. I like to prep ribs. Then I can just heat them up and have the best tasting ribs on the planet.

I like to roast bbq...a bunch of meats ahead of time so hubs can take whatever for his lunches. Also hard boil a bunch of eggs. We go thru a lot of those plain and deviled. We shop and buy bulk at Costco for meats. About 2 weeks worth. We have an ext‚Ä¶ See more

Carnivore in general is far simpler, saves time with not a lot of ingredients or clean up.

Google carnivore casserole by Primal Edge Health. Nice to have something ready to heat up.

We keep ground beef cooked. Great for taco bowls. Aldi and Frys have cheese wraps and makes great tacos with crunch!

Sundays I make all my lunches for the week‚Ä¶bacon cheeseburgers. 2 patty‚Äôs topped with the cheese and bacon. Doesn‚Äôt take much time and stacks up easily in the fridge

Tamara Harris I second this. Burger patties are the best!! Extra bacon in fridge is always a must.

I just like cooking a bunch of ground beef, crumbled and having it ready for as much as I want.

Marie Emmerich has a great cookbook, The Carnivore Cookbook. You can definitely get some ideas from her. She makes Carnivore Pizza and makes three at a time. They eat one and freeze the other two. And check her YouTube videos for great ideas.

Lisa Lauer I get my eggs from a farm. They're so good but I usually just fry them because when I boil them I have the hardest time ever getting the shell off. I mean I do the cold water bath, baking soda in water etc. Do you have any tricks?

Kimmy Kim I find that as well with farm fresh. My inlaws used to have about 100 laying hens so we got eggs all the time but after mother in law had a stroke & then dementia setting in the inlaws retired the chicken & egg end of the farm. My brother in ‚Ä¶ See more

Oh my gosh I used to prep so much, now I just have some bacon, or bacon burgers done ahead. So much easier just to cook a meat for dinner!

I cook ground beef in the morning and take it to work and a steak when I get home. Pull the next days food out of the freezer to thaw. Boom!

Frozen ribeyes. Just take them out of the freezer, salt them, pop them into a pre-heated air fryer at 450F, and in 18-20 minutes they are crispy on the outside and med-rare in the middle. I flip 1/2 way and use a probe to check temp, pulling them aroun‚Ä¶ See more

I have been canning meat. Usually at the end of the year
When my new side of beef is coming. Also great for left over venison that has been in the freezer. You tube has lots of info on this. Then I have the jars of cooked meat . Just heat. Makes a quick meal anytime‚Ä¶

Get a pressure cooker! Fast hands free meals. Or a slow cooker‚Ä¶leave it on all day while you work, come home to a house that smells like home cooking and a perfectly prepared roast. Ground beef is a great staple to have in hand. Make burger patties for‚Ä¶ See more
