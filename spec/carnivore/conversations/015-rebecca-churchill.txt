Hi, Iâ€™m just starting out after being on and off keto for a while. Iâ€™m just wondering if anyone can share what they take to work for lunch? Iâ€™ve been skipping breakfast, just having a coffee with cream in the morning and just eating lunch and dinner. I try to meal prep a few days in advance as the weekdays can get pretty busy. I did cook some mince beef with salt and pepper with a sprinkle of grated tasty cheese on top this week and have heated up precooked steak in the microwave but would love some other ideas. Thank you. ðŸ˜Š

I just cook extra for dinner the night before then dice it up for finger food. I eat it cold. Hard boiled eggs and bacon. Cheese pieces, thermos of bone broth....jerky or biltong, or I fast.

I cook extra steak the night before, slice it up and put in the fridge. Lunch prep all done! Eat it cold for lunch the next day.

I take eggs almost every day. I have a kitchen at work so I cook scrambled eggs around 11am, but other days, I might take left over scotch fillet steak, or cold bacon, or cold lamb chops, just depends on what we've cooked the night before. Hubby and I â€¦ See more

Kim Fitt do you make the scrambled eggs in the microwave? I could do that for lunch as a bit of a change.

Morning break is 10am for me, so that's my first meal of the day. I usually have some version of eggs with bacon, or cook a steak the night before and have that cold. My second meal is when I get home around 6.30 or so. I keep to the 10am meal time on days off

Julie Frost Iâ€™m trying to get down to 2 meals a day. Some days is really easy but Iâ€™ve noticed if Iâ€™m tired, Iâ€™m much hungrier.

Rebecca Churchill it wasn't something I tried to do, it just came naturally after a while. If you need 3 meals, then keep eating 3. We've eaten 3 meals a day for the majority of our life, it takes a little time for our bodies to adjust sometimes

I take my air fryer and cook steak in it each lunchtime. All it does is make everyone hungry from the smell.

Carnivore quiche is yummy hot or cold! If I make a big one, I freeze it in portions.

I donâ€™t eat lunch (I have breakfast about 11:00am) but my husband takes a large can of tuna in olive oil (Solemar brand from IGA) to the office every day for lunch. He said the one with brine is too dry and hard to swallow. He has lost 36kg since Octobâ€¦ See more

I like to do a big cookup on the weekend. Mixed meats in a slow or pressure cooker with herbs & salt. Heat on the day & take to work in a food thermos if no microwave - don't forget the broth. Enjoy !! ðŸ˜Š

Thank you everyone, really appreciate your suggestions. I think Iâ€™m just overthinking this (rather normal for me!). I used to spend so much time meal prepping and cooking, I feel a bit lost. This way of eating is definitely a time saver amongst all of â€¦ See more
