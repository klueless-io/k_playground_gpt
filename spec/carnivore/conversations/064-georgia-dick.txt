my partner is wanting to start trying to eat carnivore with me. what snacks does everyone eat during the day at work? he is a concreter and barelt gets time to stop for a smoke let alone have something to eat. he wants a good variety of easy and snacky carnivore things that‚Äôll be easy for him to eat during the day. he will be doing dirty carnivore üòä

Pork crackling, meatballs, burger patties with a slab of butter and cheese if he is doing dairy. Bacon cooked crunchy. Pork belly bites. üòÅüëç sausages

Georgia Dick I live on them, I slice the burger patty in half and fill it with butter and cheese, a meat biscuit. Cold meatballs with cold butter, same with sausage. I use the butter to up my fat intake.

Stephanie Bianca Fragomeli protein shakes are not carnivore, they're a chemical shit storm that should be avoided on any food regiment.

Just food for thought- If he is eating enough at meals there really isn't a need to snack- certainly no nutritional need anyway. Everyone is obsessed with snacks because they want to replace their biscuits and chips, but noone NEEDS to snack, it's just‚Ä¶ See more

Jeannine Everson just for the sake of using the correct terminology, not snacking doesn't equal intermittent fasting. Intermittent fasting is fasting for an extended period of time out of a 24 hour period. So for example not eating for 18 hours, and th‚Ä¶ See more

Most people on this lifestyle don‚Äôt snack. Snacking is often a habit. If you eat a decent meal to satiety it will carry you over over to your next meal.

I cook a blade roast every week for my partner's lunches. He thinly slices and wraps cheese in them. I dehydrate mine. A bit too rare for me

I don't snack, I eat once or twice a day no matter the amount of work or exercise I do.
No need to snack if fuelling your body correctly with nutritious food

Boiled eggs, baked chicken wings sardines and minced beef are my go to. However, all of these foods are really satiating so if your partner has a hearty breakfast he may not feel like eating until later in that night.

I used to eat pork crackle and jerry and cheese but slowly went away to eating eggs for brekky then a big steak for lunch and nothing for dinner as I wasn't hungry, when I'm not working I just eat one meal per day usually

If he has a good fatty steak for breakfast he won't be hungry until dinner time.

I gather that what you mean is lunch on the go. There‚Äôs no need to snack. Beef mince Patties pre cooked. You can mix some bacon and egg in there too and cook them into one solid cake.

I also don't get much time to stop for lunch, I certainly don't have time to prep and cook anything with the break I do get, so I have a good breakfast and a pack of jerky whilst I walk during my lunch break. I'm still trying to find a salt only jerky ‚Ä¶ See more

The point of carnivore is to not need to snack.
High protein is all he needs, whether thats 1 to 3 times a day is up to him. Me personally I am 2 times a day only, no snacks. Water with electrolytes and some mineral water.‚Ä¶ See more
