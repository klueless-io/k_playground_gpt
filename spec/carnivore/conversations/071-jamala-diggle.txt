Hi everyone. 3 weeks in to carnivore and was wondering what people do for bad breath? Can't use sugar gum or mints and sugar free have too many crappy ingredients. Thanks!

bad breath is more of a sign of dehydration than it is carnivore related in most cases

Can be the body expelling excess ketones you might have bad breath until you 're fully fat adapted it Can take up to 3 months

Flossing becomes more important than usual because tiny bits of meat can get stuck and cause issues

We are using Epic gum and Epic toothpaste only available online though. All others we found have sorbitol which is not good for your teeth and gums.

Peppermint oil. When you lose fat, it gets expired as acetone. Google keto breath. It will pass. It's actually a good thing.

Rinse your mouth with bicarb soda after brushing your teeth

You can try chewing fresh mint leaves if you like herbs
