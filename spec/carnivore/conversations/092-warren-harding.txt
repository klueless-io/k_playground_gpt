Can anyone recommend a good fat splatter guard? I have one from the swedish company, but my wife hates it. Thanks for the help.

I have two and they both still let splatter through.

I have 3. 2 different brands, 2 different sizes. They reduce spatter, but don't stop it. And they do act a bit like a lid and will steam your meat a bit, so okay for sausages, not good for steak. Most if the time I'd rather just clean up the stovetop.
