Yep, even before I was a (proper) carnivore, since I was a kid I've been eating raw beef, and bacon.

Richard Lampard bacon is cured in a liquid brine, not cooked. Some bacon may *also* be smoked, usually at very low temperatures, but still uncooked.
Supermarket bacon is unlikely to actually be smoked at all, even the stuff labeled as smoked will jus… See more

I've been known to partake in a meal of steak tartare (raw egg a bonus)! Happy when is meat cooked to blue or rare, but if eating raw I'd be very particular about the source and frankly don't trust supermarkets enough.

Good steak, occasionally. I usually sear the outside and have it blue.

I really, really adore sinking my teeth into a mouthwatering, impeccably prepared medium rare steak! Oh, and I'm quite a fan of steak tartare too, but I could definitely use a fantastic carnivorous recipe.

Yes, I often eat raw beef and I love it. And even long before I became carnivore when I was a kid and Mum would be putting the meat away after shopping us kids would often eat some raw mince. 🙂

Yes, I eat most of my steak raw.
I find it better for my digestion and I don't lose any of the fat.

My husband does. He will eat a raw steak if he’s out at work and hungry. He also cooks his mince Pattie’s very rare. He says he can eat a lot more meat when it’s raw but gets super full if it’s well cooked.
