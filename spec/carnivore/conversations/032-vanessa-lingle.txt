HELP lol
My husband and I are new to the diet. We are a week and a half in. We've done endless research but lately I feel like everything we initially were told to do, others are saying it's not correct/there's a better way/or we're not doing the correct things for weight loss that we are doing more of weight management. 
Can someone please tell me we are doing everything correctly for weight loss:
#1 ‚Ä¢ Fat to Protein Ratio for WEIGHT LOSS 
Right now we're doing 60% fat and 30-40% protein. We good? Need more or less of either? 
#2 ‚Ä¢Minerals!! Do you need to add any or not? 
I know I have to add in electrolytes because mine are constantly dropping especially now while going through keto flu. Also we do add salt to all meals not sure if we're adding enough though. But do we need to add in all the extras or will the meat provide those for us? 
#3 ‚Ä¢Butter!! Do you need it or not for weight loss? 
Without adding butter we are hitting the 2:1 fat to protein ratio. I don't think we should be adding any but all the videos I watch are of people just eating butter by the sticks lol. I can't stomach butter like that üòÇ 
#4 ‚Ä¢Meat! Best/Worse 
Our go to right now is beef, steak, and eggs. We loved pork before before but for some reason we can't seem to stand even the smell of pork now that we're on the diet. We tried goat it was too chewy for our liking, we like chicken/fish just don't eat them as often. 
#5 ‚Ä¢Recipes/Concoctions 
If you have a favorite YouTuber, Blogger, Recipes, ANYTHING!! that may help us enjoy eating please link it or list it below. Because we feel like we aren't creative enough. We literally cook the meat, add salt, and we're done lol. If there're any extras you throw in there or concoctions you've made that wouldn't effect weight loss we want to try them!

I thought your ratio should be 30/70% fat to protein.
You‚Äôll need electrolytes in the beginning 2-6 weeks while your bodies adjust to becoming fat burning. Some people need it for months while others don‚Äôt. There are great YouTube videos that explai‚Ä¶ See more

Ratio should be 80% fat and 20% protein. A Ketogenic diet is mostly fat. Your food choices are fine but sodium, potassium and magnesium.

As many carnivores out there is how many ways you will be advised to do things. Everyone has an opinion... Lol
It's just something you and your husband have to figure out the best way to do, for you both.

Yes there is so much conflicting information. Keep it simple. Beef is the best meat, if you can't afford steak use mince. Drink water. Salt your food. Start there. DON'T make "frankenstein foods" like pretend bread, carnivore donuts - that's craz‚Ä¶ See more

There are multiple levels of "carnivore". Basically, you want to stick to animal products - meat, eggs, dairy. Some are not able to use dairy. Some use seasonings. Some add in a few veggies. Just keep your carbs down, no sugar. I second watching ‚Ä¶ See more

I had to start by using Carb Mgr app so I could learn the proper ratios. After awhile you know and can navigate the carb world successfully. You'll get it!

Everything is good. Add salt in the meat and can take 1/2 tsp a day with electrolytes. Eat as much fat and butter as you want. Beef, rare, is best for nutrients and digestion. I like the Ketogenic Woman on youtube.

Don‚Äôt overthink it- Eat meat & fat
Since you have researched it hopefully you have thrown your iodized table salt away & replaced it with Redmonds, Himalayan ir Celtic.
Just hang in there you‚Äôll get it!
