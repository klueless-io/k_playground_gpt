Jerry Hines A1C under 7 is not reverse. You‚Äôre still doing damage to kidneys, lung, eyes and other organs over 140 glucose.

I was T2D at the beginning stages, no meds, I reversed it in 2 months with the Omad Carnivore Diet and exercise 4 to 5 days a week. Exercise is very important when it comes to t2d because it helps clear glucose from the blood without the need for insulin.

Harvard study on the carnivore diet. The self-reported changes in health status were overwhelmingly positive with a "90% reduction in all diseases while being on the carnivore diet."

Look at Dr. Fungs book and how he interested fasting in curing type 2 diabetes. I think a majority of us would agree as most of us are fat adapted under this WOE and as a result on average fast for many hours due to OMAD and TMAD.

Mine is on it‚Äôs way to remission now. I have an appointment in October and I am guessing I will be off all insulin by then and no longer be a diabetic. My sensor is currently estimating me at 6.0, I was 7.8 at my last visit. I have been carnivore for 27 days now.
