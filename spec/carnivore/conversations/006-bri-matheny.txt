genuine question, obviously it‚Äôs animal based and fruit isn‚Äôt meat, but i see a lot of people do fruit and meat diet, so i was wondering why a lot of you choose to not eat fruit, thank you :))

You Dont want ANY inflammation from fruit (carbs) if you‚Äôre eating a lot of fat. That‚Äôs what leads to cholesterol sticking to your arteries

Adameh la Elyon I agree, by itself it‚Äôs not a problem. But there is still plenty of scientific evidence that in a diet with high fat AND carbohydrates, can cause plaque buildup. The largest determining factor being inflammation.
