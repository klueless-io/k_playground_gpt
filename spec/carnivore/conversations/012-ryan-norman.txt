Just wondering what results people are having with snoring? How long did it take to stop, if it did? and how strict of a carnivore diet were you doing?

I'm not snoring anymore. Stopped about a month in, I think. I put it down to weight loss, rather than the diet itself.

Carnivore does nothing inherently for snoring, losing weight as a result of carnivore may help.
I've lost like 20kgs and still snore like a train apparently, my mrs constantly complains, as I keep telling her though, it doesn't bother me.

But then how do you explain people stopping snoring after anywhere from 2 days to 2 weeks in? Not challenging what your saying, just thinking there might be more to it 🤷‍♂️

Ryan Norman ... yes I have also heard about similar stories very early in someone's carnivore journey.

Ryan Norman it would be the reduction in inflammation. Same as low carb and/or keto. A lot of ppls nasal passages are affected, which leads to mouth breathing, and just noisier breathing all up. The weight loss, particularly around the neck/throat area… See more

Can improve allergies which improve breathing/snoring.

Dr Steven Lin has a very interesting post of the effects of snoring on the brain, fyi if anyone thinks snoring isn’t a big deal, it’s at the top of his posts

My husband used to snore all night, most nights. Since I've had him on a meat heavy diet for the last ten years, any kind of snoring is a rarity.

I have sleep apnea (extreme snoring) my rate of apnea prior to cpap was 45 incidents an hour. With cpap used to be 12 an hour now 2 per hour. Due to a bone abnormality in my throat i will probably never cease to need cpap . But this is a really significant improvement

My husband really struggled with snoring and he has only been carnivore for about 3 weeks and he hasn’t snored for a week, it’s fantastic.

No snore, but never a huge one anyway .. but am told now that I need to be checked on to ensure I’m still alive 😂 super quiet, and super still, with a low resting heart rate. Also changed from breathing thru my mouth to always my nose these days.

Michelle Therese I’m not sure of all the mechanisms at work, but there is some reasoning which I can’t remember. And then also I’ve lost weight and got cardiovascularly fitter, which has also helped reduce it. But that’s not the only reason. Just can’t… See more

After 2 weeks I stopped snoring but before i stopped I realised I was breathing a lot easier, now thinking that it was a reaction to food or condiment that I had always been eating .

I had a significant reduction in snoring intensity, but it's still there sometimes, just not as loud. Not sure how long it took, wasn't immediate.

Meat, fish, eggs and dairy, with plants as seasonings. I suspect that dairy contributed to my ongoing mild snoring, and if I eliminated it the snoring would clear up.

My husband doesn’t get sleep apnoea any more, and he doesn’t snore. We think it is because he lost weight around his neck.

Apparently inflammation and fat gets stored in the tongue.
Going a carnivore diet reduces both. That is why reduction or even elimination of snoring occurs!
