Has anyone found that their stomach had a negative reaction to pork chops on the carnivore diet? I had one for lunch for the first time on the diet and my gut feels strange and my anxiety kinda flaired up. It's still my first week on the diet, so that may be part of it. Just wanted y'alls' opinion.

Could be the nitrates depending on the brand. Try local pork if it's available to you

Amanda Pope it was from costco. Didn't say it was organic or anything.

Sarah Thompson I know nitrates and sulfites give me headaches and sometimes anxiety. Organic usually works for me.

Pork chops are not cured. So they shouldn't have added salt or sugar or nitrates.

Nicholas Waggoner thank you for the confirmation, I think I will just do beef. Does Bacon bother you at all?

Pork is one of the harder meats for our bodies to process so o can imagine that is why it gave your stomach troubles.

I love pork of all kinds, but I had to stop eating it. Except I can still seem to use bacon grease to cook with!
It makes me super tired & anxious at the same time when I eat pork chops or ribs. But I was fine when I ate the ribs from a wild hog my hu‚Ä¶ See more

I had the same experience. Then I got to thinking ab the price difference between a pork loin and a beef loin and i remembered "you get what you pay for".

Pork generally never really agreed with me
Bacon was always fine but too much of a pork loin or butt or chops and I would feel ill

I eat a large thick cut pork chop at least once a week. Love them... It's actually my surf and turf preferred combo. A thick pork chop and some large shrimp saut√©ed in garlic and butter... MMMMM..

Most grocery store pork contains enhanced solutions. Could be that.

Pig don't sweat, so toxins stay in the meat. I have to phsyc myself up to eat it, which is hardly ever.
