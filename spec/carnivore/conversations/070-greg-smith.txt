Starting to get beyond frustrated. I’m basically intermittent fasting 14/10 every day.  I eat ground beef and or bacon then have a steak for dinner. Usually ribeye. I have been rucking with a 30 pound vest or walking without it for two weeks at 3 miles a day and 6 miles on Saturday and Sunday.  ￼ definitely getting in better shape but I have not lost a single pound in two weeks.  I’m not obese, but my stomach and love handles are still obvious. Not sure how I need to change my eating or something

Peter Play it’s not about the weight. It’s about the visual. The stomach and obliques should be shrinking

I haven’t been eating much bacon for the past week, but I get it from my butcher. Zero sugar and all natural supposedly.

Greg Smith there are many factors. If it was me, I would cut down to one meal a day.. But keep focussing on how you’re feeling better. All the best on your journey!!

Muscle weighs more than fat. The weight will come off and maybe add more fat

Hi Greg Smith, What diet are you coming from? Are you eating the fat? What does your sleep/rest pattern look like?
This lifestyle is optimal. Not seeing results means your internal organs are healing. The SAD has made many people extremely ill. … See more

Extra stomach fat and love handles are last parts to away, I think🤷🏻‍♀️ I’m not over weight, and my body fat% is between 14-18(average 16)%, but I still have some that I can grab unfortunately 🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️
Try fasting longer, change up your routine… See more

For me initially I was only able to see results by how I felt and a measuring tape.
This is a process, your body is trying to achieve homeostasis and working it hard is going against that. You are likely building muscle (not a bad thing) but as we all… See more

If you can handle it, maybe do a longer fast. I’m doing Alternate Day Fasting . Granted I’ve only been on this WOE for 2 weeks. But with what we eat, I don’t get hungry all the time and I’m able to push myself to 36/12. Absolutely easier to fast longe… See more

It’s true what they say, abs are made in the kitchen.
I’ve only finally started to see mine and it’s been because I’ve started this way of eating but I’ve been doing core workouts for years. So I had a solid base of muscle under there that was just c… See more

Try one meal a day and a 48 hour fast during the week. That's all I do, no exercise and I'm dropping weight exceedingly fast.

Give it time. I gained 10 pounds and didn't lose it for 6 months. This is a healing diet. It's more important how you feel. 🩷

I heard a podcast today. You have to fast long enough so what you eat in your feasting window works or refine your feasting window more. I do 18-20 hrs fasting.

Measure and go by your measurements. Also, depending on your age, too much exercise can increase your cortisol.

14/10 really isn’t intermittent fasting
You should shoot for at least 16/8 at a minimum. 18/6 even better

Are you eating until you are completely full? I wonder if you aren't eating enough? If your body thinks it's starving, it will dial down your metabolism so that it's harder to lose weight.

I have been doing 18 hour intermittent fasting for the past 3 years. I have a bulletproof coffee with 2 raw eggs and a scoop of enhanced collagen protein in it about an hour after waking up, and I eat 1 meal. I eat till I am satiated. No snacks. A snack is a meal.

Trust the process. You are building muscle which weighs more than fat. You are gaining back for every pound lost. Do you feel better? Sleep better? Reduced health issues? There are many benefits to this diet, weight loss being obesity of many. C… See more
