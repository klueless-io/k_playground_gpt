Does anyone else get a hangover when they break ketosis? 
I had fried chicken with some friends on Friday and I honestly feel like I went out and drank a bottle of jack. 
Feel like absolute dogshit since Friday

I understand where your coming from its probably because you have been eating clean meat for a while you've cleaned yourself out. And now you've had fried chicken which is more than likely cooked in canola or sunflower oil.
And it feels like you've â€¦ See more

Yep, when I used to do keto I would always suffer if I ate bad foods. Haven't eaten badly this round with carnivore, but last weekend I drank wine and cocktails and I swear my hangover lasted two days ðŸ™„

Just think that that is probably the way you used to feel when eating that type of food, however you have slowly transitioned to feeling the way you now "normally" do since you changed your lifestyle.
When you eat the crap again, you have gone back to feeling crap

I was fasting for 3 days and made the mistake of breaking it it with a Chinese buffet. I only had meat options, no rice or noodles at all.
Worst "off the wagon" reaction I've ever had. For reference, I cycle 20km to work and my heart rate doesn't go that high.

Absolutely, I would almost go so far as to say I get derealisation. Never worth it.

As well as the seed oils you are, there would have been a decent amount of carbs. This disrupts you electrolyte and hydration homeostasis significantly, like alcohol does.

We get vague and tired and get BO as we detox again - think that's the worst bit. We never smell normally when eating clean.

Yes, everytime I have a small cheat it equals the feeling that I've drank a bottle of Wild Turkey. Throbbing headache but gone in 24 hours.

Congratulations, you learnt a valuable lesson. I learnt mine over 2 years ago with a piece of birthday cake. Sick and headache for the next day and a half...
