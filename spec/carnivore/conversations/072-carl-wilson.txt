I take it and sauerkraut regularly because I don’t have an appendix, to add good bacteria back in. ACV is supposed to help lower insulin as well.

Nathan Knapp my appendix burst in April and I didn’t realize it for two weeks and wound up with four surgeries and four drains. I have horrible pain in my abdomen and eating is really painful at times. Do you have similar pain?

Nathan Knapp I had my appendix removed a few years back, can you explain how this negatively impacts digestion? I don't know anything about it.

May be an image of text that says 'What is the function of appendix? APPENDIR ArPEsOIONs Why do we have an appendix? The entire digestive tract helps with our immune system, but some scientists and doctors think the appendix may be a place for our body to store certain healthy types of gut bacteria that otherwise could be altered or changed during an intestinal illness or with overuse of antibiotics.

May be an image of text that says 'What is appendix and why is it important? The appendix has been found to play a role in mammalian mucosal immune function. It is believed to be involved in extrathymically derived T- lymphocytes and B-lymphocyte-mediated immune responses. It is also said to produce early defences that help prevent serious infections in humans.'

It's ok to get advice about acv from non carnivore doctors. It has many health benefits. 🙂

Debra Bevans try half tablespoon in a cup of warm water. Then build up to a whole tablespoon. Never have it just on its own.

Definitely helps raise pH of the stomach to close esophageal sphincter when adapting to higher fat diet which relaxes it.

Mary Kelley I havent come across this information before about the sphincter. So the increased fat could cause reflux?

It’s a plant product, so it does absolutely nothing of value for you if consumed. It’s a great cleaner for windows and a fabric softener. Not worth consuming.

Nathaniel Lineberry just curious … where is your research on this response. Many DOCTORS say differently … your opinion doesn’t count and confuses others.🤔

I’ve found that ACV helped me with my acid reflux while I transitioned into carnivore. Settled my stomach while I got used to the high fat diet.
