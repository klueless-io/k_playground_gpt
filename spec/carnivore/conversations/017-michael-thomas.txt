My iron level seems low after 6 months of carnivore. It's only a 7 umol/l from my recent blood test, the recommend range  is 11-30. Any ideas on this?

Many cofactors with iron deficiencies you need to test. This is the panel I get done regularly. I had low magnesium. Sorted that and took beef liver tablets and all was resolved. https://therootcauseprotocol.com/ideal-values-for-lab-tests/

May be an image of text that says 'Iron Studies (Serum) Coll Date: Coll Time: Lab Number: 18/02/22 09:10 6035049 03/08/22 07:50 7141895 01/08/23 07 07:46 10983698 Ferritin Iron Transferrin Transferrin Sat. 67 15 2.7 22 109 23 2.4 38 L 89 7 2.2 13 30-300) (11-30) (2.0-3.6) (20-50) L ug/L umol/L g/L % Transferrin saturation result means iron deficiency is not excluded The ferritin result can be misleadingly elevated in patients with co-existing inflammation. If applicable, consider repeat fasting morning iron studies when the patient is well. Tests to follow: HbA1C'

Angela Oliver I had one about 6 months ago and had one polyp removed. 12 months ago my iron was 20.

Michael Thomas interesting...
There's obviously a reason you're not absorbing the iron.

Angela Oliver yes. Kate Kate has mentioned about magnesium and liver which I will look into.

Iron can be absorbed more with Vitamin C. So you may need ti supplement that with your meals.
Do you consume any dairy? As that can impact iron absorption also.
