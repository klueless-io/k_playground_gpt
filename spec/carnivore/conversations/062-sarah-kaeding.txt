Hello carnivores 
Since going carnivore, I noticed I have a metallic taste in my mouth and is always dry, no matter how much water I drink. Is anyone else experiencing this?

Very common, can last days to weeks. Think it is to do with change over to Ketosis but stand to be corrected. Keep up the water and it passes.

Are you supplementing with electrolytes? ðŸ™‚ the metallic taste is ketosis or "keto breath", it generally goes away when your body gets better at using up all the ketones it creates

Electrolytes!! Many of us need these amounts daily ! Too many advocate for not needing them
When Iâ€™m fact they are a game changer for most of us

You need electrolytes because you would have lost a lot of them when dumping carb bound water.

It happens to me if I fall off the wagon and when I start going back into ketosis. Not often but noticeable

Metallic taste in your mouth sounds like youâ€™re detoxing heavy metals through your mouth. When you get better nutrition and raw fats your body can start dispelling things finally.

Electrolytes we need salts to properly absorb water or it will go straight through you and you will remain thirsty

When your body starts making ketones and switching over to fat burning it can cause a metallic taste in your mouth and/or different smelling urine. It usually gets much better after a couple of months.

Celtic salt...put a little in your water, will help a lot to rehydrate. Also gives you electrolytes as it's very rich in minerals

I like the raw flavoured LMNT salt supplement. Works for me.

When my mouth is dry despite drinking lot of water it tells me I need electrolytes.
