Iv been going strong for a week and a half now and feel fine, but, I can’t stand eggs and also, the thought of organ meat turns my stomach lol. My diet has consisted of beef, pork,  seafood, cheese, and water.. with that said, and considering I feel fine, should I be worried about not eating the eggs and organ meat?         TIA",
