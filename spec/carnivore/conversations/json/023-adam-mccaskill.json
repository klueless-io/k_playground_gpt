Today after sitting down all day at a conference I got a massive leg cramp in my right leg. Iâ€™ve never had such a painful crap in my life. Iâ€™ve only been only taking magnesium tablets for the last two or three days and wondered if this is cramping is normal. Any suggestions of overcoming this would be greatly appreciated. Iâ€™m enjoying the way of eating and already lost between four and 5 kg.ï¿¼\n10 comments\nJenny Elliott\nAdd salt and more salt",
