Specifically want to hear from those who were diagnosed before you started carnivore?\nI have been diagnosed with Spondyloarthritis and have had severe flare ups for over 12 months. I have been carnivore for over 3 years. (NOTE. CARNIVORE DID NOT CAUSE MY DISEASE, UNFORTUNATELY MY GENETICS HAD OTHER PLANS FOR ME)\nI was just wondering if those who were diagnosed and started carnivore has seen any improvement in their conditions? Certain meat causing flares? I have stayed away from pork, it really causes me a lot of pain.\nI was thinking the other day, I wonder if my diet has had any affect on my condition, and how much worse I would be, were I not carnivore (even though my flare-ups have significantly impacted my life) ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”\n28 comments\nJames Andrea Harris\nI have osteoarthritis and it's definitely helped my joints especially my hands",
