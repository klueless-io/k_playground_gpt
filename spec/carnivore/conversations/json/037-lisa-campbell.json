  "content": "\nHey guys, I am in need of a bit of encouragement. Day 59 of Carnivore,  I eased my way in, but been 100% compliant for 3 weeks. I am wanting to get off diabetes medication, feel better, and of course, lose weight. I need to lose at least 35kg  I started at 120kg and had the initial flush, of 5kg  but have been sitting at 115kg ever since. Yes I know I shouldn't believe the scales, my clothes feel a little looser, I have less inflammation, and havnt had any anti-inflamitories for over a week (yay). I can't say I have more energy, but I don't have less. Cravings have not been bad, and am generally enjoying what I have to eat. I guess I am just a bit disappointed that I havnt lost more weight. Cheer me on plz guys!! ðŸ¤¤\n21 comments\nKezza Bella\nYou are going great, you are healing on the inside, visceral fat is melting away from around your organs, your stomach microbiome is healing. There is a lot happening inside, that you probably don't realise. The weightloss will come, but more than thatâ€¦ See more",
