  "content": "Hi guys (and girls), I purchased a large Sunbeam slow-cooker this week and the first thing (so far) I've cooked in it was a lamb half-leg roast from Coles.\nI cooked it for 6 hours on 'low' and then left it for a further 2 hours on 'keep warm.' When I had some yesterday, and again today, it was cooked fully but no better than if I had cooked it covered in the oven for 6 hours - cooked but not tender.\nAm I able to cook it in the slow-cooker until it is literally falling off the bone, and if I can, for how long does it need to be cooked? TIA.\nETA - my next try was a 2kg rolled pork roast. I put it in and only added a glass of red wine, and cooked on low for 10 hours overnight. It literally fell apart and tasted wonderful - for the next 3 days, lol.\nThanks everyone, for all the advice, much appreciated.\n31 comments\nLinde Driessens\nI leave my meat in for as long as I can, sometimes up to 12hrs. I check after 8 hrs to see how it's going.",
