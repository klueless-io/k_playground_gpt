  "content": "Hi, Iâ€™m just starting out after being on and off keto for a while. Iâ€™m just wondering if anyone can share what they take to work for lunch? Iâ€™ve been skipping breakfast, just having a coffee with cream in the morning and just eating lunch and dinner. I try to meal prep a few days in advance as the weekdays can get pretty busy. I did cook some mince beef with salt and pepper with a sprinkle of grated tasty cheese on top this week and have heated up precooked steak in the microwave but would love some other ideas. Thank you. ðŸ˜Š\n34 comments\nTanya Maree\nI just cook extra for dinner the night before then dice it up for finger food. I eat it cold. Hard boiled eggs and bacon. Cheese pieces, thermos of bone broth....jerky or biltong, or I fast.",
