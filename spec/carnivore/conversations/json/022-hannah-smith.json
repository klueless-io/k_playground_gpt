I’m now on day 3 with no slips in the food department but am still having some wine.\n23 comments\nChad Bromley\nIt’s hard but it’s an easy excuse. Everyone I slip up I think damn if only that wasn’t in the house but then realise that ultimately it was still my choice to eat it.\nMy wife does now put all that junk in boxes so I can’t see it sitting on the shelf, that does help a lot",
