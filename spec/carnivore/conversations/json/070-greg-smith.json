I have been rucking with a 30 pound vest or walking without it for two weeks at 3 miles a day and 6 miles on Saturday and Sunday.  ￼ definitely getting in better shape but I have not lost a single pound in two weeks.  I’m not obese, but my stomach and love handles are still obvious. Not sure how I need to change my eating or something",
