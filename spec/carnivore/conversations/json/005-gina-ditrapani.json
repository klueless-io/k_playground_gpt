I'd like to use Pauls Pure Cream because it pours. I don't want the kind that leaves a big oil slick on the coffee. I eat lots of fat already.\nThat said, if I start making bulletproof coffee, I can just use unsalted butter, right? No need for MCT oil on Carnivore, I guess. (But I still want to know about the heavy vs pouring cream.)\n92 comments\nRussell Searle\nThey’re the same. I use the Pauls cream. Blue carton. It’s pure cream skimmed off the top.\nThickened cream is 50% cream 50% crap (gums and rubbish to thicken the goop)",
