  "content": "HELP lol\nMy husband and I are new to the diet. We are a week and a half in. We've done endless research but lately I feel like everything we initially were told to do, others are saying it's not correct/there's a better way/or we're not doing the correct things for weight loss that we are doing more of weight management.\nCan someone please tell me we are doing everything correctly for weight loss:\n#1 ‚Ä¢ Fat to Protein Ratio for WEIGHT LOSS\nRight now we're doing 60% fat and 30-40% protein. We good? Need more or less of either?\n#2 ‚Ä¢Minerals!! Do you need to add any or not?\nI know I have to add in electrolytes because mine are constantly dropping especially now while going through keto flu. Also we do add salt to all meals not sure if we're adding enough though. But do we need to add in all the extras or will the meat provide those for us?\n#3 ‚Ä¢Butter!! Do you need it or not for weight loss?\nWithout adding butter we are hitting the 2:1 fat to protein ratio. I don't think we should be adding any but all the videos I watch are of people just eating butter by the sticks lol. I can't stomach butter like that üòÇ\n#4 ‚Ä¢Meat! Best/Worse\nOur go to right now is beef, steak, and eggs. We loved pork before before but for some reason we can't seem to stand even the smell of pork now that we're on the diet. We tried goat it was too chewy for our liking, we like chicken/fish just don't eat them as often.\n#5 ‚Ä¢Recipes/Concoctions\nIf you have a favorite YouTuber, Blogger, Recipes, ANYTHING!! that may help us enjoy eating please link it or list it below. Because we feel like we aren't creative enough. We literally cook the meat, add salt, and we're done lol. If there're any extras you throw in there or concoctions you've made that wouldn't effect weight loss we want to try them!",
