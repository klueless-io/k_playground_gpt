All over the splash back in the air then dropping on my doors and so on.\nI now use a fat spatter things for the fry pan and its knocked it down a lot but still get fat in the air.\nMy Cast iron fry pan is amazing. Gives my steaks that amazing crisp.\nAir fryer love it. But its starting to smoke on high cooks due to fat splatting up into the area of the fan which I cant clean.\nPaper towels are a life saver. Wipe out all the fats before I wash anything to save my drains.\nAnd last but not least. My mini milk frothier which makes my morning coffee with butter all fluffy on the top.\nAnyone else got tips for rookies or pros?\n14 comments\nLaura Gomes\nI use air fryer liners\nI get mine from Temu\nMay be an image of 1 person and text that says '8:44 TEMU 2/14'",
