Water (with adding salt)\nFor lunch I will have pork scotch fillet steak or beef mince/steak with westgold butter. I‚Äôm also having bacon and eggs\nFor dinner I tend not to have anything or if I‚Äôm hungry I will have a small beef patty\nI‚ÄôM NOT LOSING WEIGHT\nMY INFLAMMATION IS GETTING WORSE (to the point I‚Äôm thinking of getting a cortisone injection into my ankle) I HAVE GOT ARTHRITIS IN MY ANKLE\nI work full time in childcare care ( just had a 6 week break)\nI joined a gym and go swimming 6 days (after work)\nI‚Äôm 65\n2 years ago I was going keto with huge salads for lunch filled with vegetables, nuts, seeds,protein and oils lots heaps of weight, felt great able to move lots and had a clear mind. I was able to fast doing OMAD fasting up to 36/48 hours I was able with the help of bone broth to do a 5 day fast..\nI tried to go back to having salads but my arthritis flared up so much that I couldn‚Äôt walk\nI don‚Äôt know what to do\nCurrently I‚Äôm sticking to\ngreen tea and water\nSteak, mince beef\nPork scotch fillet\nIf anyone knows of a GP if S.A.
