Or you just stick to your original diet?\nMy diet is pretty much just meat/eggs now.\nI have never had to worry about traveling because I usually just avoid more-than-2-day trips. But I think it‚Äôs time for me to become more knowledgeable about this. I guess this is what I will do:\nIf I am going camping, I will probably just eat what I usually eat( I have done this. just bring the things I need with me and cook my own food)\nFor other trips, especially traveling long distance/ going to another country, I‚Äôll probably either fast, or just eat eggs I can get my hands on (they‚Äôre everywhere and you can use the microwave in a convenience store to cook them so I don‚Äôt need to bring anything with me except for a container and a spoon)\nI don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll cheat because I don‚Äôt want to put crap in my body, so maybe that means during the trip, I will need to sit in a restaurant with them while eating nothing and eat eggs when I have free time\nI think fruits I like are acceptable but not optimal so if I really can‚Äôt find eggs I‚Äôll probably eat some fruits (or just fast)",
