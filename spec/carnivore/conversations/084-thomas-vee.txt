I like the evenings, but my medication works better with a bit of protein so I may shift to big brunches. I work construction and don't like to eat a lot while at work, but it depends on if it's an indoor or outdoor job also.

HGH has the best chance of producing when you’re on a fast - so, during the night until you “break” the “fast” the next day - whether first thing in the AM, or later. The longer the fast, the more HGH the body will generate.
I don’t know about others, but I find it way easier to continue my night’s fast through the morning, then eat 2 meals/day. Which one is heaviest depends on your situation.
Also - I find my AM workout much easier to do on an empty stomach.
