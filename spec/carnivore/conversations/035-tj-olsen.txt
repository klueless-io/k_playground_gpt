Lean carnivour doesn't work. Another of nutrients are found in the fat. You'll get side effects like hair loss if you don't eat enough fat!

Jolene Perdue lol. Umm. No, you won't. ü§£ü§£ you are listening to misinformation. There is PLENTY of fat in all the meat you are eating. Stop adding tons of fat. You will not losenyour hair, unless you are on a low or no fat diet.

I‚Äôve needed to gradually increase fat consumption as I‚Äôve progressed: mainly as I noticed I wasn‚Äôt sustaining energy and was becoming lethargic when consuming moderate fat

I thought the whole point of carnivore was to burn fat? So fat is an important ingredient.

I think it depends on your goals. Everyone is not trying to lose weight. Some people lose more weight eating leaner higher protein, and less fat. The women on this podcast cut their fat to lose weight https://youtu.be/tgWtaWxHVe4

Regular "eat the meat " and stop adding tons of extra fat caenivore, works amazing. üôå there is ENOUGH fat in meat. Stop it people. Your gall bladders are going to stop functioning. Smh.

Too much lean meat not good from a point of view of blood glucose control and weight loss. Too much protein is converted to glucose, you need more fat to convert to BHB ketone. Excess glucose is stored as fat, excess ketones are either burned as energy‚Ä¶ See more

Dr Berry says fat to protein ratio should be 2:1 for maintenance and 1:1 for weight loss. Too little fat will reduce energy as it is where our energy is now coming from. I‚Äôm fairly new so just reiterating what Dr Berry said

Protein poisoning (also referred to colloquially as rabbit starvation, mal de caribou, or fat starvation) is an acute form of malnutrition caused by a diet deficient in fat and carbohydrates, where almost all bioavailable calories come from the protein in lean meat.

The Carnivore diet is a ketogenic diet which your energy system converts from carbs to fat so 80% of your calories should come from fat
If you don't know this then you are not Carnivore. It is the base of the diet, protein is only 20% of the macro nutrients.

We eat meat w the fat it has on/in it, and make sure we alternate chicken w fattier red meat. Don‚Äôt remove any of the fat/ skin except when frying bacon (find its too stomach heavy if we consume all the drippings).
