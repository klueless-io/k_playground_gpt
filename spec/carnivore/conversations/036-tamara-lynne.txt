$12kg Lamb Roast, stuffed with Butter and Salt, scored skin and salt rub. Cooked until crispy on the outside and red in the middle. I then suck the marrow out of the bones, and let my dogs briefly chew on the knuckles

Joanne Kerr how do you roast your brisket please? I've tried and it turns out like old boot leather. 😬

Kris Jay It needs to be of a minimum weight of about 1.4kg to roast well in the oven. Less than that, it will dry out before it is properly cooked. I also rarely use a piece over 1.8kg. I cook it in 150c oven for 6 hours. I put it in a Pyrex dish, tip… See more

I practically live on T-bones and pork belly. I do love the odd lamb chop too. Eye fillet is 👌, but keep that for special occasions due to price.

Karissa Parker isn’t rib eye the American term for scotch fillet?

Bev Bradley scotch fillet is rib eye yes, but the difference is the bone has been removed from one
