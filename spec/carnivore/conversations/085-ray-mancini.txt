this can be a very individual thing - may depend on what "baggage" you bring to the practice

Meat, heavy on the beef and lamb. Eggs. Butter. Sardines. Tuna. Salt and butter on everything.
Plenty of sunshine and exercise. … See more

I was taking 60+ supplements a day before. Now I’m down to magnesium, iodine, msm and liver capsules.

Angela Brooks I would add D3, if you’re not getting enough sun exposure and K2 to balance it out.

Douglas Morgan I sit outside 20 min daily! I just had my levels tested. I will supplement during the winter. Great advice!

Angela, doesn’t hurt to add K2, especially if your eggs aren’t pasture raised or meat isn’t grass-fed. Grain fed beef is low in K2. D3 increases calcium absorption, as you know, but K2 puts it in bones instead of soft tissues.

Water. Salt to taste. Grass-fed bone meal &/or pasture, raised eggs. Sardines daily. Pasture raised, egg yolks daily. Shellfish and liver once a week. Enough grass-fed ruminant meat and organs to provide the calories you need.
