I am curious to know, if anyone feels comfortable to share. 
Does anyone suffer from any arthritic disease on here? Specifically want to hear from those who were diagnosed before you started carnivore? 
I have been diagnosed with Spondyloarthritis and have had severe flare ups for over 12 months. I have been carnivore for over 3 years. (NOTE. CARNIVORE DID NOT CAUSE MY DISEASE, UNFORTUNATELY MY GENETICS HAD OTHER PLANS FOR ME) 
I was just wondering if those who were diagnosed and started carnivore has seen any improvement in their conditions? Certain meat causing flares? I have stayed away from pork, it really causes me a lot of pain. 
I was thinking the other day, I wonder if my diet has had any affect on my condition, and how much worse I would be, were I not carnivore (even though my flare-ups have significantly impacted my life) ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”

1 it is not genetic , it is deficiency in, minerals that is the root cause and when it involves arthritis it is either boron or copper where the deficiency is

Augustus Ceasar So all the studies done on individuals who carry active an inactive HLB-27 genes are all inaccurate?

anything related to gene research is very questionable , certainly not based in truth

I have erythromelalgia, itâ€™s not an arthritis disease but a neuro vascular. Chicken and pork on a regular basis causes flare ups for me along with seed oils as the main culprit. Lamb and beef I am best with.

I am 35 and have (and have since I was 15) juvenile disc deterioration disease. I also have hip displasia requiring surgery in the next few years. Sadly no reduction in pain. As wonderful as this way of eating is- itâ€™s not going to fix bone issues- butâ€¦ See more

Emma Dudman I have degenerative disc disease too. Hasn't helped that side of my chronic pain either. At least I'm not alone there! You read so many stories of people saying how it's fixed all of their pain issues yet here we are going...

Shanowa Mathieson yeah. Itâ€™s a great way of eating and looking after your health - but itâ€™s not a fix all.

I've had RA for 30 years. I've been carnivore for almost 4 months. Healing is defintely slow for me and my RA meds probably don't help as their very job is to reduce my immune response, thereby reducing my RA. Having said that...I feel my inflammation â€¦ See more

I reversed psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, fibromyalgia, and other health issues. Keto and carnivore helped, but strict Lion Diet (ruminant beef/lamb, salt and water only) was when the major change happened

I have arthritis and my joints were so painful before cv. Pork is problematic for some including me, as ruminants are said to be best ie, beef and lamb.

What are you eating? Did you drop down to only unhung/unaged beef and nothing else? If not, you're still technically getting inflammatory foods that could contribute to your inflammatory disease (albeit a minor amount).
