Let’s talk tools, tips and cleaning. 
Love to know what has helped you in this journey and your clean up tips.
With a lot of the food we cook I’m getting a lot of fat in the kitchen all over the place. All over the splash back in the air then dropping on my doors and so on.
I now use a fat spatter things for the fry pan and its knocked it down a lot but still get fat in the air. 
My Cast iron fry pan is amazing. Gives my steaks that amazing crisp.
Air fryer love it. But its starting to smoke on high cooks due to fat splatting up into the area of the fan which I cant clean.
Paper towels are a life saver. Wipe out all the fats before I wash anything to save my drains.
And last but not least. My mini milk frothier which makes my morning coffee with butter all fluffy on the top.
Anyone else got tips for rookies or pros?

Can you cook outside? BBQ?
I find using BBQ’s a life saver, but it really depends what you are cooking and what tools you can use. I will say it a million times, instant pot duo crisp, I barely have any mess, maybe have to clean the area once a month… See more
