Hi all, just starting out on carnivore and am wondering how you get past your family eating the standard diet and having to shop for them, having the temptations in the house and also quitting alcohol. I’m now on day 3 with no slips in the food department but am still having some wine.

It’s hard but it’s an easy excuse. Everyone I slip up I think damn if only that wasn’t in the house but then realise that ultimately it was still my choice to eat it.
My wife does now put all that junk in boxes so I can’t see it sitting on the shelf, that does help a lot

Tell them you’re doing this for your health. I slowly start to replace items with healthier options. Also doing online click and collect you only buy what you need and not being tempted in store. Over time they will see the results. It’s easier to live… See more

It will pass and you will look at carb foods like you would look at a cardboard. Completely indifferent. Cooking it is a bit harder for me. The only thing I have soft spot is a freshly baked bread.

Brad Nils sounds easy but there are social situation where you catch up over wine and a good meal, now I can do neither (unless I cook my own meal 😜)
I’m determined though so I will be cutting the wine 👍

I found the good thing about this lifestyle (don't call it diet anymore) is that family meals remain the same but I just have the meat. If it's a roast I get just meat. If spaghetti bologase I use some mince to make patties etc

Know your why! I found it easy, I don’t look at their food the same way anymore, not tempted one bit.

Watch any YouTube video you can regarding food addiction, preferably in the carnivore space.

Shan Aeril thanks, I have watched so many YouTube videos, I have tried carnivore a few times in the past and failed due to being the only one in the house eating this way, I have a much better chance of succeeding this time as my hubby has joined me 🤞

You remember what your past eating habits were like and as time goes on you know what makes you sick and sluggish..I have hopes my health conditions will improve bit by bit I think I'm getting there.

Hey good stuff giving it a try. You’ll soon find that your body will stop craving the sugar content and the temptation will disappear. I now crave a spoonful of duck fat to the disgust of my kids!
