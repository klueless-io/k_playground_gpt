I would look at the ratio of fat:meat. You may have some underlying health conditions and really need to be on a therapeutic diet. This would be a 2:1 fat to meat ratio. Try to stay in ketosis with 2mmol/L blood ketone level. Also about 400 grams o‚Ä¶ See more

Kristi Conner Bradfute I take cod liver oil and I just noticed the hair following out after putting on sum hair gel on it. I ate junk over the weekend might have caused it but never had before.

Cathy Moore cod liver oils is definitely held to high esteem and considered healthy. It Appears to add healthy fats. But it doesn't replace liver when referencing nutrients.

Elaine Sangiolo each person will have a different protein to fat ratio. Higher fat tends to be easier on the hormones and adrenals. That's why coaches will always recommend higher fat sometimes 80% calories from fat and 20% calories from protein for healing.

Could it be thyroid related?

Rhonda don‚Äôt go to a regular doctor they use the US standards for thyroid levels. You want a hormone specialist who uses the EU guidelines.

Make sure you are getting enough fat, red meat as primary protein. Drink lots of bone broth or a good quality collagen not made with plant collagen.

More fat less protein, you need 1g of protein per body pound of body weight desired, theres around 25g of protein per 100g of beef which for me being 155 desiring to be 175 I need only 700g of beef per day and the rest is just bone marrow üëç we need way‚Ä¶ See more

Supplement with Vitamin D, it's essential in a lot of things like making iron or using protein. Up your water intake and sprinkle a little baking soda in it. These VERY ESSENTIAL things help MANY things.
Vitamin D is necessary to make and use iron. ‚ù§Ô∏è best vibes!

Mine did as well at the beginning but it stopped after a while and is healthier and thicker now. I think it's normal to have hairloss when your body is adjusting to a new WOE

Sounds like body is repairing itself then will build back stronger. Eat clean carnivore, add in a few grams of liver daily

If you had covid or the jab, it could be related. It comes back! I have not had the shot but was really sick and 3 months later lost alot of hair. It comes back. Look on you tube, it's a huge issue.
