I cook in a lot of tallow or butter or bacon grease. I use a spatula to get every bit onto my plate, dip every bite of steak and then lick my plate when Iâ€™m done.

Kaye Federspiel I follow an 80/20 split and I eat a lot of red meats (if it's a lower fat cut I will add grass-fed butter to increase the fat), we eat baby back ribs, rack of lamb, and lots of eggs cooked in grass-fed butter. Occasionally adding some raw cheese as well.

Sardines, pork rinds, short ribs, high fat hamburger, ribeye, eggs, bacon. Cook with duck fat, lard, tallow, butter. Use heavy whipping cream. . . and more!

I have butter in my morning coffee, or just with hot water. And I have a large dollop with my steak. Always cook my eggs in butter as well. That seems to be enough for my body.

Kaye Federspiel it's like sour cream, but thicker. Has the consistency of thick pudding.
Cheap too, only one Euro for 200 ml. One cup has 60 grams of milkfat and not much else

Tough to say without knowing what you're currently doing. This is one of my regular meals:
150g burger patty using 85/15 ground beef with a slice of cheddar (~22.2g):
33% protein, 67% fat

Kaye Federspiel triglycerides are a type of fat that are the most abundant in the body. If you consume more energy than your body requires then it gets stored since your body doesn't need to use it for energy.

Kaye Federspiel if you eat way more fat than you need, your triglycerides are going to go up.

Butter butter butter. I don't know how people can just eat a stick by itself. I can eat a few pats at a time. I just add it to everything as a dipping sauce. I can't handle the texture of fat on meat so it has to go. I sometimes add egg yolk toâ€¦ See more
