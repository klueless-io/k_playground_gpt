Just do it. Clean out the fridge, cabinets, and pantry of everything not carnivore and watch YouTube videos by Dr Ken D Berry, MD and Dr Chaffee.

Its best to start with Keto-vore then ease into Carnivore if it's tough for you

Chris Rivers Can also supplement with protein shakes but make sure they don‚Äôt have any sugar. Monkfruit ok .
And keep an eye out for Maltodextrin it‚Äôs an artificial sugar that worse for you than cane sugar and does a worse number on insulin resistance.

John Ouillette my protein shakes have munk fruit and coconut sugar. Total 2g and the rest are various mushrooms with protein from: pea protein. Hemp. Chis. Pumpkin coconut. All the naughty seeds. Lol. I‚Äôd like to give what I have away.

Jumping on board isn't necessarily for everyone. I personally find that if I jump into something without proper preparation and understanding, I fail before I even begin. But that's me.

Doing the same thing over and expecting a different result is the definition of insanity. If it‚Äôs not working, try a different approach. Ease in, it‚Äôs likely better that way anyway.

It‚Äôs not your just that programmed. So many foods and ingredients just aren‚Äôt food and we were all fooled into consuming them. Start slow and build into it.

Because you don‚Äôt really want to do it. You want to try it but you don‚Äôt really want to commit. It‚Äôs not hard you just don‚Äôt want to put in any effort to change how you‚Äôre eating.

Do a gradual conversion? That's what I did. I could not justify tossing all the non-carnivore food. I stopped buying it & cut down to meat with 1 side dish. When the sides were used up, I was gradually converted to carnivore. Felt great the whole time.

After being told about this and researching for myself, I donated everything none Carnivore in my kitchen- if you don‚Äôt buy non carnivore wood then you can‚Äôt eat it! Once you see the weight loss and lack of brain fog you‚Äôll be totally motivated
Good luck

Take time to work into it! I needed about 2 weeks to adjust: to get used to my electolytes, to use cottage cheese to combat sugar cravings, to get used to eating fat with the meat, to get used to the texture of bone marrow in my eggs.

I think one of the main societal concerns/ pressures is the lies about cholesterol.
Dr. Aseem Malhotra talks about cholesterol with Joe Rogan. They don‚Äôt talk specifically about the carnivore diet, but they do talk about how cholesterol is not bad. ‚Ä¶ See more

It's not, and mostly just a mental weakness issue, but years of shitty eating also causes addictions that can be tough to kick. Just have to get your mind into the state of having the will power to treat your body well and not like a garbage dump

My Pastor‚Äôs wife asked me if I was addicted to sugar and I said no. Years later I‚Äôm doing carnivore and I saw the power of the addiction. I was truly a sugar junkie and carnivore got me out of it.

No artificial sweeteners really helped me. I had no cravings after day 4. I also made my own spices with zero carbs. So mine is technically dirty carnivore. I also do dairy but am now easing away from that.

Learn as much as you can before starting. Don‚Äôt believe it to be easy peasy research anything and everything that can go wrong so you can address and adjust accordingly if it should go wrong. I‚Äôve had many pitfalls, but most of them I was able to approach with knowledge üòâ
