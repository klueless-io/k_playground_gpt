Just a couple of questions if it's not an annoyance to anyone please:
1. Are we supposed to limit cream and cheese?
2. Is it OK to have coffee and if Yes then:
3. Can you add some powdered milk based coffee whitener?
Thankyou very much

Up to you how strict you want to be. Some will tell you no to coffee as it comes from a plant.

Coffee may be from a plant but a "lot" of people won't give it up, myself included.
I have long black with a pinch of Celtic salt or a couple of teaspoons of grass fed butter or 30 mls pure cream .
Coffee mate is a no no, read the label.… See more

Hi Marea, are you healing in any health issues? For instance, autoimmune or leaky gut. If that is the case, and you are completely committed, it is worth going full lion diet in the beginning. This means just beef salt and water. After a couple of mont… See more

For some people, when they start carnivore they have the whole diarrhea situation early on. A lot of the time it's because they've increased their fat intake to more than they can handle. Coffee can exacerbate that because it can act as a laxative for some people.

I enjoy coffee with cream. Especially in the morning and also after dinner as a replacement for dessert.

If you’re in it for weight reduction I’d skip the milk powder as there’s a lot of “sugar” .It stalls my weight loss.

I drink fresh cream straight like a dairy maid, and enjoy it. About 100mls 3x a day.

I make a keto milk, it’s a 500mil pure cream and 500mils water mix in a jug, this reduces the carbs and cheese is not so bad but you eventually put weight on so if you do have it limit it greatly.
Good luck with your journey

I drink lots of coffee ☕️ with pure cream every day and have lost all my arthritis pains and 25kg since October. I use an aerator so the cream is nicely mixed in and I don’t get that film on top of the coffee. I also eat cheese 🧀 maybe 1 slice of norco… See more
