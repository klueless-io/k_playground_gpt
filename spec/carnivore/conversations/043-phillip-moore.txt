What is it breaded with? Chicken, milk, eggs are ok. I would use crushed pork rinds for the breading.

Chicken is a side dish. Not enough fat. Red meat is main course at every meal!

Jason Chudej no idea how much or what part Phillip Moore is talking about. Breast without skin is 31grams protein and 3.5 grams of fat - way under what you need.

Very strange post. Chicken breast is generally awful, but it cooks in about 10 minutes in a pan. Unless you overcook it and then it's practically inedible!
If you are serious, the product you're talking about is gluten free but definitely not carnivore.

I understand cooking takes time. But if you‚Äôre trying to improve your health, you have to put in the effort. You can certainly find time to put a whole package of chicken breasts in a pan in the oven, cook 30-40 minutes, wrap them up and you have ready‚Ä¶ See more

P.S. thaw the chicken the day before, or cook 4-5 pounds on Sunday and eat them through the week. I think beef is more satiating and nutritious, but if you prefer chicken there are better ways than this brand of chicken.

You can‚Äôt thaw it in the fridge the day before? Personally I freeze everything then sous vide it. I can fully cook a frozen chicken breast in under an hour like this.

Any meat I get out of the freezer the night before and let it thaw in the fridge. Chicken is super easy and quick to cook, regardless of how it's cooked

Yep, chicken doesn‚Äôt take long at all. Even ‚Äúbreaded‚Äù in pork rinds to make it carnivore. You cut the chicken into strips or pieces‚Ä¶ 3 minutes. You coat it in eggs, then the pork rinds‚Ä¶ 5 minutes. Fry it in tallow‚Ä¶ another 5 minutes. What takes so long‚Ä¶ See more

Phillip Moore you think it‚Äôs expensive because you‚Äôre just starting. The longer you do it the less you eat. I‚Äôve saved a lot switching over to this. 2 ribeyes for $16 is 2 meals. Add a couple eggs and your done. Takes less than 10 minutes to cook.

Phillip Moore Yes, it takes a bit more prep time. Chicken isn't the best choice in meat. Beef is far better, and if you can't afford steak get mince. Make patties - just mince - cook up a heap and put them in the fridge to grab when you are hungry. ‚Ä¶ See more

Lean meat is not good when you‚Äôre doing the carnivore diet. You must have two times as much fat content. Thighs and wings are good. Stay away from chicken breast. Unless you‚Äôre cooking up some fat somewhere.
