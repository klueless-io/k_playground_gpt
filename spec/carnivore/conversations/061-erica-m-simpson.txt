Has anyone used this lifestyle as means to rid of asthma  allergies and chronic  respiratory infections (sinus/ rhinitis)
I am wanting to try this way of eating to hopefully help with these things ðŸ™‚

It's excellent for lung disease and asthma. I have significant copd and after 15 years of doctors poisonous steroids I am off them all.

What also helps is nebulising saline and colloidal silver, saline nasal irrigation and a mouthwash to finish

I will second the silver nasal spray! Ionic silver before bed does wonders.

Yes itâ€™ll help. Just make sure those issues arenâ€™t actually being triggered by mould exposure though.

20 plus years of high and higher doses of corticosteroids and still symptomatic.
Currently 3 years off them with minimal symptoms.
