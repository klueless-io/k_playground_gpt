I have been on this WOE for 3 weeks. There is one thing I am missing the most and that is Blueberries so it‚Äôs probably the sugar I‚Äôm craving. üò≠ I had 20 fresh locally grown blueberries tonight they were so freakin good!

Sheryl Fortini maybe only eat them while they‚Äôre available and not freeze them. Don‚Äôt you think our ancestors would have eaten them when they were available? I‚Äôm guessing primitive man watched what the animals ate and would be willing to fight a bea‚Ä¶ See more

Eat until you‚Äôre full. Have the proper amount of protein and fat. Which would be 70% calories fat and 30% calories protein. A good ribeye is that portions. Also hamburger is compatible. Just eat until you are full. This should take the cravings away.

Berries are probably more in line with what a hunter gatherer would have consumed on a primitive diet. Just try to only eat non GMO berries that are wild and only when they would be in season in your region. To say a hardcore carnivorous populatio‚Ä¶ See more

Terry Taykowski Actually blueberries are GMO in that they are a hybrid and were never really naturally occurring. They are in the wild now, and I've picked wild blueberries, but that just because birds distributed their seeds when eating the berry.

Fran Racy what else would have been in regards to fruits and veggies? Did they eat wheat? If I‚Äôm not mistaken, didn‚Äôt many eat corn?
This isn‚Äôt a judgement, I‚Äôve just been wondering what our ancestors really ate.

Actually my understanding is fruits is ok doing the animal based WOE and it‚Äôs ok to do whatever works best for you as I‚Äôm doing classic carnivore with doing little sauces when eating meats and works great for me

90% meats, my nutritionist said if you need to eat a veggie keep it at 10%. Your berries are in line of hunting and gathering you should be fine
