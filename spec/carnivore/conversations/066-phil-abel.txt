Couple of vague newbie questions if I may ! Can meat be stored frozen indefinitely ? What is the best method to store them, in a zip lock bag, wrapped in paper etc, or is it ok to freeze them as per photo ?
TIA

I freeze like that. Cut beef can stay frozen for 12 months - or that‚Äôs the recommendation, it‚Äôs never lasted in my freezer that long as I eat then replace. Defrost before cooking in the fridge for a day or so - or in the sink submerged in cool water, t‚Ä¶ See more

It‚Äôs ok to freeze them as is if you have room in your freezer. Excluding air is important and it‚Äôs good to have a device that does that, they come with their own strong ‚Äò cut to size rolls of plastic bags. We package a lot of our bulk buys this way. It‚Ä¶ See more

one of my best investments was a food saver - vacuum sealer. I buy whole rumps, rib fillets etc, cut to my thickness preference (butcher cuts for free) and seal. Cheaper then buying individual pieces.

I buy whole rump, slice it myself, put in freezer bags, store in a big freezer. Just rotate stockü•∞

3 main items you'll need to make life easier ... Sous vide, Ninja air fryer, Vacuum sealer. I vac seal & sous vide all my beef/liver freeze/defrost/air fry, don't bother sous vide lamb/pork straight in the air fryer.

Greg Forknall I have an air fryer and I don't think the sous vide style is for me as I like my meat well done and charcoal crispy ! The vacuum sealer however is definitely on my shopping list !

Freeze it like that. Or, if you bulk buy at the butcher I just pack them in freezer bags

I would vacuum pack those & marinade at the same time - I defrost in the fridge & wet age them for a bit

Remove as much air as possible to avoid freezer burn damaging the meat. They say up to 12months in freezer.

These vac sealed meats can be put in the freezer as they are, as Dave said above, but make sure to consume them within 4 months. Especially if your freezer doesn't go lower than -20¬∞C

My butcher vacuum seals for me for free when I buy bulk.

But some stainless steel racks take all meat out plastic bags
