Anyone tried renpho scales? Reviews or advice? I get dexa every 3 months but want something I can use regularly at home in-between to monitor progress....

Love our renpho scales. Probably not as accurate as a dexa but you can still see if water, weight, bone mass etc. shifts. This is a picture of my water weight shift when I started carnivore.

We bought the usb rechargeable with bluetooth. It is nearly 5 years old now. It has been fun watching the graphs on the app, especially the visceral fat and metabolic age. I went from 8 visceral fat to five and metabolic age from 61 to 55 (I am almost 59).
