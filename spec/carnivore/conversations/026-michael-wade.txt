This week is my start on carnivore. I was just wondering how much do I eat?  It has been preached to me to eat protein at least six times a day, and track macros. But since starting I am lucky to get three meals in. Just seem to stay fuller longer. Is that normal?

Eat meat and eggs when hungry until no longer hungry

No need to track anything. Eat 2 meals if you like and eat til your satisfied. Protein and fat. Simple as that

I only eat one meal a day and I have eaten as little as 1.75lbs to as much as 3.25lbs depending on quality and density of meat. It is different for everyone
