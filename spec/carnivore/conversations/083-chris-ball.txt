Is wagyu really that good? Anytime i see videos of someone cutting into a fatty wagyu cut I'm kinda grossed out. Lol i like a fatty cut but it just looks like too much.

I had ground wagyu and it was great. Lil expensive but it was delicious. Haven't had a steak but I want to try it.

Wagyuâ€™s quite rich, obviously not a every meal type steak imo

As wagyu has lots of marbling, is it grain feed to give that texture or grass fed? ðŸ¤” I'll pass on grain fed. ðŸ˜¬

Craig Allan Wagyu is a breed of cattle that is bred for the marbling and high fat content.

My husband and I treated ourselves to a waygu steak for the first time and it was quite delicious...I could cut it with a fork! Not something we're going to eat regularly though because our budget limits us to no more than $5 a pound

The Wagyu that is the big deal is the A5 grade version. Don't waste your money on anything other than that. Its just marketers playing off of peoples ignorance of what this beef is. Its being treated just like Angus. Angus is marketed to be "better" itâ€¦ See more

I have never had good wagyu in the USA. It wasn't bad but nothing special. I have had amazing beef in Japan. It is not the same.
