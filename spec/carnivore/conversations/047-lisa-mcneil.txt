My husband started this about 3 weeks ago.  He lost 16 lbs the first two weeks but gained 2lbs this last week.  He wants to keep losing and wanted to know what adjustments he needs to make before he starts gaining more. He eats meat, eggs, hard cheese, bone broth and some full fat cottage cheese.  Just wondering if he should up his protein or up the fats.

Pull the cottage cheese and maybe the hard cheese for a bit and see if it helps. Sometimes though healing slows the loss for a time.

Try removing the dairy and upping the beef. Mine stalled when I added a small amount of dairy

Yeah I’d give up the cottage cheese. It has (natural) sugar in it.. like 5 grams of carbs. Other ppl have said deleting dairy has helped them. I’d start there first

Does he intermittent fast?? Dr Cywes says not to eat before noon. He has coffee in the morning and that’s it until noon. We’re trying that. So it’s not a hard core IF, then just OMAD or two he says.

Stop weighing for 90days, he's most certainly losing inches .

Fast and use more butter with your beef.

He may have gained muscle, which weighs more than fat. It might just be his body is adjusting.
