I need to intermittent fast aswell. Eat until you're not hungry rather than eating until you get that full feeling.

Have a look at Kelly hogan, myzerocarblife on utube. She was obese, infertile and unwell and she is now slim, healthy and has kids, but she gained weight for the first six months of her carnivore journey. Trust the healing process, let your body fix ‚Ä¶ See more

I was down to 76kg (ideal weight) from 81kg after 3 weeks and have maintained it. Much less joint pain for me and better sleep because not waking with pain!
My son has lost 14kg of total 30-40kg to lose in his first 3 weeks. I‚Äôm so pleased for him.

I'm 6 months in and have lost 24kg. Still got 10-12kg to go, but I've hit a bit of a stall. Poor food choices (sick kids and being sick myself hasn't helped) and just not sticking with it 100% has caused it. Hoping to slowly drag myself back on track t‚Ä¶ See more

This happens to me a bit and I swear, laying naked in the sunshine for half an hour does the trick. Full body sunlight exposure really has helped me to where the "slow downs" are only for a couple of days. I also tan now where I didn't before.

Lost 32kg since 28/11/22. 16/ 8 eating each day and 1 or 2 24hrs fasts per week. Weeks without fast weight stable, but fat decreases and muscle gains

I have lost 35kgs in 7 months. I was so careful to stick to carnivore- no cheats what so ever! 2 meals a day , meat with fat , eggs, a little cheese no butter.
I‚Äôm not so strict now and not losing or putting on but will get back to it soon.

I've lost 6kg/13pounds in a couple of months. Inches more so. I'm trying to budge menopause related fat which is harder than body fat. So it's slow.

Down from 97 to hovering between 89-90...
Not been strict for a while now, too many visits to movies and my Mrs had her 50th recently. Aiming to get strict again and drop another 10 and see how the body is then.

I've gained. I don't eat in excess, don't usually hit more than 1100 calories if I'm lucky. But I haven't trained since my hysterectomy either. And I have PCOS and IR. I WISH it would just fall off üòí

Day 30 today for me on carnivore. Down 9.5kg. Still wanting to loose another 15kg or so. But more importantly I feel so much better already. Decreased the inflammation in my body a decent amount already. My shoulders haven't felt this good in years... it's not as easy when I'm on site as all the steaks etc are fairly lean. I'm still working on ways to counteract that bit.. I'm still only eating carnivore on site also.
