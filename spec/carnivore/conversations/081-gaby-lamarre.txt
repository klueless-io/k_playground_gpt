Anybody still drinks coffee in moderation? I started the diet 4 days ago and i am doing really good but i miss drinking coffee. I researched it online and some websites says no coffee and other ones says its ok with heavy cream.

Me. I am lucky to not have any underlying conditions. I stopped all caffeine for 3 weeks but felt no different.
Went back to my morning coffee with cream.

I have autoimmune (UC) and still drink coffee - lactose free milk as I can't get raw easily. 2-3 per day. Sits fine with me, but decaf only as I notice a struggle with normal caffeine now

I gave it up because I just lost interest. I'm 52 and have drank coffee for all of my adult life. It just tasted blah to me. Gave it up. But I do drink hot water w 2 TB butter and 2 egg yolks with cinnamon. Blend it up and it is very soothing and fâ€¦ See more

I recently gave up for 4 weeks after all the hype. Horrible withdrawal but decided to go back on it. I didn't notice any difference other than the headaches. 2 cups with butter if I'm not fasting

Never stopped drinking it with cream and still dropped 30kg in 9 months.

I gave up because I drank it with sugar. I donâ€™t miss it. Itâ€™s a plant so itâ€™s not acceptable to me as a 99% strict carnivore. My only variation on my carnivore plan is a couple low oxalate spices.

Gaby Lamarre maybe before giving up the coffee try without whipped cream. Unless you have had whipped cream in other applications, that could be the cause. If not, then at least you know that coffee is not for you.

I don't drink coffee daily, but that's just what makes me feel best.
