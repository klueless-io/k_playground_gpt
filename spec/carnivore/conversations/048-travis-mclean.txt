Just remember. It’s a lot of meat with a little bit of dairy, not the other way around. 😂

Travis McLean week 2 on carnivore I did a bunch of recipes with dairy and it wrecked my digestive system. Took me a week to get it back on track and was miserable.

Pepperoni is always made with sugar. So a big no from me.

Depends on why you are eating this way. Weightloss, the cheese will stall you. Inflammation, the pepperoni will get ya. Just because it’s healthier for you and you have no ailments or weight to lose then it would be completely fine. Everyone’s journey is different!
