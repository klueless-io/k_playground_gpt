A question for the endurance athletes in here, do you get super hungry at times during your training or events? I do and I wonder if it's true hunger or something else. I don't eat anything till I get home. Curious if it happens to others

Send a super chat to Dr. Chaffee. He interviewed a decathlete recently. Perhaps he could help you.

I have a 50km trail event in 4 weeks. In my long runs I have no sugar electrolytes and salami sticks. I do well that way. I used to go through so much more in the SAD way. I find my body just keeps on going.

Astrid 'Flowers' Boyle yes I thought about a meat snack of some kind. I've just been doing electrolytes. Good luck for your event! I'm hoping to do a 56k trail event end of September ü§û

I‚Äôm fine if I eat a big ribeye the night before. I can ride 100ks on that. But today i got hungry at the 50k mark, but I also had a cold this week so it‚Äôs hard to know. I think recover time might play a part

Toni Stubing remember this is my mantra and as a carnivore coach...not eating till you get home might not be serving you well. This is a way of eating and living, not a diet so you NEED to eat more!
