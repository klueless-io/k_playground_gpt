Hey Carnivores! 
Somehow sugar, sweets (mainly chocolate) have crept back into my diet. Looking for some advice on how to combat sugar cravings again? My will power isn’t as strong as it was when I started carnivore 8 months ago

What’s your excuse and is it strong enough to go back to your old way of eating. It’s all up to you, no softening the blow here. Sorry 🙏🏼❤️

Don't let yourself get hungry eat until your full don't snack, load up on fat too

I’ve had to do this. Just removed all the treats around the house. Back to OMAD, and literally stuff myself at night so I can’t fit the rubbish in anyway. Routine of cleaning up, chores, fun, shower, earlyish bedtime etc to keep me on track also helps.

Only way is just not to buy them and have them in house. I'm glad though when I went through it,I didn't have kids living in the house anymore as that would have been hard.

I find I get sugar/sweet cravings when I’m not keeping my water and electrolytes up, it pairs nicely with higher levels of fatigue that I get with my autoimmune issues…. Well that’s my balancing act…

Maybe you weren't eating enough fat -- so your energy levels were low, and then, by giving into temptation, you went out of ketosis. Once you are no longer in ketosis the craving for glucose might come back as your body needs quick energy.

Literally have will power, it's easy to not eat chocolate for one day, so focus on that.
The next day repeat.

Have other, keto/carnivore, snacky foods in the house ALWAYS, so that you have SOMETHING you CAN eat when your willpower or emotions are low. I've lost count of the number of times I have almost made myself sick eating heaps of cheese rather than attac… See more

If it’s not in the fridge or the cupboard, you won’t be tempted.

Just stop. Push through any craving and in a few weeks they will be gone.

Don't buy it, if it's not in the house you won't eat it, just eat more fat.

That happened to me at the beginning of this year. It took me a while to give up the sugar again but I did. I've been sugar free since July. For me, once I realised that it was more about the routine than an actual physical need, that's when it became … See more

Dr Paul Mason suggests a basic glucose lolly if ever required...

Don't eat dairy, the lactose will trigger carb cravings. If you're eating only meat, the carb cravings should be gone in a few days max

I recently had to do this too after a prolonged stressful situation. I knew my cortisol levels were high and the cravings were bad!
You just have to get your mind around it first and remain determined to get off the carb merry go round.
Only took 3 day… See more

I find that information about the damage sugar does to the body and mind helps me not want to eat it. Maybe listen to a few YouTube videos that might help. Sing out if you need suggestions 😉

Why would you eat that ? Do you want health or not? Seriously, once the desire for health is more powerful than the need for a quick sugar fix, then there is no question about what you are going to put in your mouth.

Eat butter or bacon when the sweet craving hits, it's the fat that should adjust the cravings for sweet stuff.

Is it a sugar craving or cacao craving? I can go without sugar but I really struggle to go without cacao. Lol. I try to stick to 80% dark chocolate, or a ceremonial cacao (uses the whole bean so includes the cacao butter in it) to make a “cacao tea” an… See more

Iv been eating honey, with blueberries and blackberries and Greek yoghurt. Because I’ve been craving sugar. ￼ it’s healthier than eating a doughnut.￼

Take a stroll through the wards at your local public hospital. You'll know when you've hit the cancer ward. That cures you for life. 😉

Saying that one should just stop eating sugary things is like saying just stop smoking or using heroin.
