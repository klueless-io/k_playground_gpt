How do you guys usually go about eating when traveling with people that are not on the same diet ?
Do you just have a few cheat days? Or you have looser rules? Or you just stick to your original diet?
My diet is pretty much just meat/eggs now.
I have never had to worry about traveling because I usually just avoid more-than-2-day trips. But I think it‚Äôs time for me to become more knowledgeable about this. I guess this is what I will do:
If I am going camping, I will probably just eat what I usually eat( I have done this. just bring the things I need with me and cook my own food)
For other trips, especially traveling long distance/ going to another country, I‚Äôll probably either fast, or just eat eggs I can get my hands on (they‚Äôre everywhere and you can use the microwave in a convenience store to cook them so I don‚Äôt need to bring anything with me except for a container and a spoon)
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll cheat because I don‚Äôt want to put crap in my body, so maybe that means during the trip, I will need to sit in a restaurant with them while eating nothing and eat eggs when I have free time
I think fruits I like are acceptable but not optimal so if I really can‚Äôt find eggs I‚Äôll probably eat some fruits (or just fast)

Why do you need the same diet? My BFF is vegan. We still find ways to eat at the same place that caters to both people.

John Cue The same as you would have before. Pick a restaurant and find your food. Last week we had Thai. I ordered a ton of chicken. It really is not that complicated üòâ

When I have gone out with friends and coworkers, they know my way of eating so they are usually up for finding a place where I can order a steak, burger, fish etc. On occasion, I have sat by without eating. I would eat before or after cuz everyone chos‚Ä¶ See more

I‚Äôm more lenient when it is harder to control, but IÔøº don‚Äôt go crazy. E.g‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd never eat a bagel or a donut, but will eat less than ideal sausage. You have to pick your battles.

Surely most places have meat dishes?

Tanya DT Not where I went in Rural Cornwall, UK. The closest thing I found to meat was deep fried sausages, packed with wheat, fried in seed oil.

I'll look for Argentinian steakhouses whenever I go travelling. they usually don't even use spices, they just grill the meat. I cannot cheat, not without ending up feeling crap for two weeks, that's how long it takes for the body to dump oxalates, if t‚Ä¶ See more

I went on a 2 week travel and decided to go ketovore, because it made things easier... I had to adjust a bit from day to day, but didn't 'cheat', had no reappearing pains to speak of and stayed energetic and active, so it worked well... üòä

Charlotte Hjorth-Petersen, I'm curious how your body adjusted while you were on the 2 week trip. I am going to Israel in October and have been carnivore for 3+ years. I never have fruits or vegetables. I was just wondering if it would be hard on my dig‚Ä¶ See more

Vonda Williams Smith I'm 2 1/2 year carnivore. Never had fruit or veg either.
While travelling I didn't have fruit, sugars etc. I prepared my stomach by eating a bit of saurkraut or small pickled cucumbers for about a week before I left. I was staying‚Ä¶ See more

Vonda Williams Smith I just hope, you'll have a great trip ‚ù§Ô∏è It's very hard to plan something you don't really know, what will be... so with some basic rules in the back of your head, it might make it easier, if you suddenly have to make snap decisions üòä

I tend to switch to a more keto diet. It just give a little more flexibility.

I have heaps of consideration for my own well-being, and simply polite consideration for others who might question my food preferences.

I am going ona weekend trip over labor day and I have thought about it quite a bit because I will be the only one eating carnivore. I will stick to plan because otherwise I will not be able to control myself. Abstinence for me!

I just got back from a weeks vacation in the UK with my carb addict family.
I was 100% carnivore all week.
Was it easy? No. Was it worth it? Hell yeah!
