If you need to do OMAD for a couple of weeks on a budget, what would you recommend bang for the buck? I am in a country that has terrible steaks and nothing fancy, so fatty ribeye etc are not an option.

High fat content ground beef, bacon, eggs, dark meat chicken ect. 🙂 also- you can by frozen beef hamburger patties (go for as few ingredients as possible) and you can pull those out 1-2 at a time and cook them 🙂

Most humans can live a month with no food using its own fat as fuel.
If you are poor and have no money any kind of food you can scrap by will be good. … See more

Some ground beef(cook med-well in a pan) and 4-6(or more) sunny side up eggs(or runny scrambled eggs) on top with extra drizzle of butter✨😋✨ that would do for me👍🏻

Jennie, yeah, you can have as many eggs as you want, but jus don’t get too full, and make sure to have enough butter(if you can) with food, and that’ll keep you full for a long time🙂🙂🙂(at least to me) 😀
Like this✨😋✨

Jennie, and eat when you are “good” hungry, which means not from first thing in the early morning only because you used to eat “breakfast” at that time, if you know what I mean,,,
I usually wait till 11am, 12pm, or 1pm,,, or I’d eat later than that if… See more

Buy a sous vide cooker for under $100. Use it on cheap tough meats to save a bunch.
Top with butter or butter mayo.

Maria Emmerich has written a book, The Carnivore Cookbook, with lots of ideas for variety using ground beef. I’m impressed and ready to start cooking!

I alternate ground beef burgers one day and bacon and eggs the next. It means that it prolongs the feeling of food boredom for me.

I do OMAD most days of the week with bacon, eggs, butter, and ground beef. If you really have trouble feeding beef patties or steak, try to best form of hotdogs available-preferably ones that are zero carb and all beef.
