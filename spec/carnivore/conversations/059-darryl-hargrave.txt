Hi im looking for advice or examples of how the carnivore Diet has helped or cured Rheumatoid Arthritis in Woman in their 50s .
My Wife developed R.A suddenly after having the Astra zenica jab , and is struggling with constant pain and discomfort, can hardly walk and her wrist and hands are crippling her physically and emotionally.  I'm hoping to get realistic experiences from ladies that know and have successfully treated this horrible disease .please help if you can or reach out privately to her 🙏 Trish Adele Picker ❤️

I find bone broth helps massively with my joints.

Look for someone like a kinesiologist who can help clear the toxins from the jab from her system.

Trish Adele Picker Hi Trish, just came across this post, look up Mikhaila Peterson on youtube. She has overcome massive arthritis issues since a young age, both her and her father have transformed their lives on carnivore. Cheers Mark
