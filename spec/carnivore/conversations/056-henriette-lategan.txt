What are the most common excuses you hear from people why they don't want to or can't do Carnivore, and what are your responses?

"Can't go without me veges"
"Love me veges"
This one really gets me though...... "Love me pumpkin too much" 🎃 ...... of all things. 🤔🤪👌

Mum in law says she's has heaps of allergies although we know the majority of them are made up but she believes it. And her diet is what weight watchers told her to eat like 30-40 years ago.

Bayley Ilona Vasvari-Shepherd wouldn't surprise me. She has ridiculously swollen legs and feet and cant walk without a walker and some days that's hard for her and I suggested this woe to her and she won't budge. She's 78 and set in her ways.

I have Vegans attacking me all the time. They shout over me so I can not get a word in.
Vegans are a angry tribe. 🇦🇺😎

Diane, vegans are a "hangry" tribe, 24/7, cuz they won't feed their bodies with what they are cleared craving to be fed! 😞

All I ever hear is mainstream conditioning from robots who can't think objectively or exercise an open mind.

They would prefer to take Pharmaceutical drugs and have gastric bypass surgery than give up their favourite toxic foods.

The simple fact is that your average person would rather just take whatever the Dr prescribes, rather than do the hard yards of changing their diet

I can't go without my alcohol is the one I hear regularly. I wish people would at least try carnivore and then decide if they really need alcohol.

You have to understand that when people have been told there whole life to eat a certain way they will , I also understand people are just lazy and take the easy option for me I’m still exploring how to go about it as it’s kind of hard in my job to take the diet on

My husband commented to me nearly 1 year ago.
"Maybe I should have followed your advice about diet & cut out all of that bad food. I probably would have not got cancer & maybe lived longer"
Too late .

Say congrats on being vegan/vego because you know... ( pause for dramatic effect ) you have already killed more animals than what I will ever eat even if I live to 100.
