Day 7 on carnivore and I have felt completely fine until today! Everything is going straight through me 🫣.  For those who experienced this, how long did it take your body to acclimate? What did you do to ease the “liquid release”🙄? I feel maybe my body is in shock as I was a high fiber eater before swapping to NO fiber. I just need reassurances that this won’t last! Because I feel horrible right now.  And I have never had any gallbladder or pancreatic issues…but I know my body is probably in a state of confusion with the drastic change 🫤

Timing depends on a lot of variables. I eased into carnivore, suffered constipation followed by a bout with hemorrhoids which only lasted 2 days .... Eating fat is required to transition... You'll be so glad you stayed with it ... Know that it WILL get better soon.

I had spastic liquid release for 45 days, before I realized that my brand of magnesium had something to do with it!!
I was taking magnesium oxide … See more

I had the carnivore flu for maybe 3-5 days. I felt great the first week and a half and then not so great. But it passes, so hang in there!

I use psyllium husks in water once a week to add the necessary fibre for the bowel to function properly as I suffer from diverticulitis (old persons disease) and have done since I was in my early forties. Psyllium has no carbs or other nutrients at all… See more

No such experience at all. These problems occur with me because of coffee, magnesium or too much fat. Not because of the meat or cheese or eggs

I’m still battling well over a month of sudden, explosive diarrhea. I’ve tried changing several things, but nothing seems to work. I’m not giving up though. My weight loss stalled after 16 lbs.

I’m on day 24 and just starting to really feel better but there are still some episodes 🤣 I know I’ll feel better in the end though so I am just pushing through!

The melted butter can be a problem with this the first month or so. They say to eat it cold to help
Alleviate your symptoms.

Denise Dube Woodward I backed off on the butter even cold and that has resolved my issue. I am going to slowly add more fat. I believe I need to do a slow transition coming from my past eating habits!

I never had problems with digestion and evacuation. I just go to the bathroom less often
