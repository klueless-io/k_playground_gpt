Bridgette De Gouveia Probably, but Dr Mason doesn't post often enough and Dr Chaffee's videos are too long to squeeze in on the go. Dr Berry is Goldielocks - entertaining, informative, regular, and perfect-length videos.

He's an acquired taste. I have watched his videos but prefer watching & learning from others.

I used to - until I saw a YT of him eating McDonald's patties. That was enough for me. Haven't watched him since. If he thinks Macca's even qualifies as "food" then he isn't someone I want to listen to.

Chris Smith Dr Anthony Chaffee said he looked into the patties and he says they are fine.

Geoff Hunter exactly! I can’t see him slamming down Maccas Pattie’s on the regular. I’d say it’s an on the go option.

Trish Randall I like them too but for some reason I find Dr Berry easier to watch. The others can seem a little bit dry. Dr Berry has a big personality.

Keera Mitrokli yeah. I get that for sure. But I’m kinda the opposite. I like the real nitty gritty and over the top information in Dr Chaffees podcast. And I summarise it down to post in my group for those who can’t or won’t listen 😂😂. It’s been pretty popular 😉😂

Dr Cwys is good too. His videos help with the veteran carnivores like myself. The changes you may have to make once you’ve healed and reached your goals.

I've watched an odd one but prefer the general public YouTubers who are telling their own story and how they navigate life.

Dr berry after he recommended spam & frankfurts etc if u can’t afford real meat.
I thought that was a bit fanatical…
