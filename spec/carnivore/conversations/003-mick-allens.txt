How many hours to slow cook a brisket at low temperature on an instant pot or an all in one? Will I need more than a cup of water? Thanks!

I use a slow cooker and usually turn it on first thing in the morning, 6 to 8 hours. longer if you can. one cup of water is plenty.

I donâ€™t add any liquid. I put the fat side facing up in the slow cooker so it drips down. I usually cook on low for 8hrs or so. ðŸ˜‹

Louise Higginbotham that sounds delicious, thanks for tip. Which slow cooker do you have? I have the all in one but I want to get a dedicated slow cooker.

Mick Allens I think itâ€™s a Breville, not home to check. Just a plain slow cooker, nothing fancy. Big enough for my brisket slab!

Louise Higginbotham yeah brisket or lamb shanks for me in the slow cooker, no liquid some salt. Once done I like to shred and crisp up in butter in hot pan!!

I use around 1 cup of broth. Depending on the size 6-8 hours on high or until it probes like butter

I put 1 to 2 cups water. I love the brisket juice, I use it as gravy or to really amp up mince.
I sear the brisket, place in pressure cooker. 2 hours, check water level is ok, then 1 more hour.

Thanks everybody. I tested out Philips all in one slow cooker function. I open the lid to find liquid boiling in the cooker. I didn't think slow cooker gets that hot?

Mick Allens remember waterâ€™s boiling point is really low, like 100 degrees
