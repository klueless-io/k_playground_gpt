I've been buying organic meat on Saturday, steak, sausages, bacon, mostly and not too many preservatives I hope.
I have been refrigerating and eating that meat during in the week.
Do you think there's meat last seven days okay or should I be using Freazer?

4 days is my food shopping limit. Never bothered with freezers.

I cooked up about a kilo of beef last week and kept it in the fridge and it lasted easily 5 days, I enjoyed it and my dogs loved it. Snags always seem a bit dodgy unless cooked as soon as I get them home, bacon I divide up into portions and freeze

Is the meat vacuum packed? If so, I would have no problem keeping the steaks and bacon in the fridge for a couple of weeks but I would be freezing the sausages! Having said that, it depends on a few factors! How long has the butcher hung the meat for bâ€¦ See more

Ryan Robb the meets are vacuum packed but I noticed a little oxidation on some of the meat on day 7 and that's why I posted the question
