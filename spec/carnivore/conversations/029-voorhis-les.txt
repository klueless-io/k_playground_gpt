My wife and have changed to a Carnivore about 60 days or so ago with great results! However we are still taking our supplements as we are concerned about getting the right and proper vitamins and minerals that we know are present in organ meats. That being said, we HATE organ meats. Weâ€™ve tried various recipes, mixing them with other foods etc. and just have not developed a taste for them. Thoughts and ideas or do we have to settle for the reality of taking supplements to fill in gaps were missing?

Good question!!
Can you tell that your supplements are actually working?
I would imagine that it depends on what you are taking!! â€¦ See more

Some videos say it isnâ€™t necessary to eat organ meat so maybe supplement them instead?

Dr Chaffee says you don't need organ meat. That you get everything you need in ruminate meats. I have been taking fulvic mineral drops for awhile because I drink filtered water.

Dr. Chaffee said we should eat proportionally, head to tail. The proportional amount of organ meat to muscle is very small, so you donâ€™t need much. If you feel like you need more, then take supplements. Itâ€™s your choice. You make the rules.
