Thank you. So, if I understand you, I may not be fat adapted yet? I wonder how long that takes? Going to wean myself off PPI's next. Cold turkey didn't go so well.

Haven't been tested yet. Definitely seems weird. How do you feel? Would your doctor lie?

Not what I was expecting. I get the results online here. My doctor hasn't seen the results yet. Nor does she know that I am on carnivore. Looking forward to an interesting conversation when she sees the results.
