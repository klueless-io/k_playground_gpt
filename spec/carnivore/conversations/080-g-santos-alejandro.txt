I went through that. It took about 1.5 weeks for my body to acclimate. I never took any laxatives or anything. Give it a few more days. You can also add a bit more fat.

My husband and I both could not tolerate that diet , eating animal protein fruits and vegetables is much healthier , he never had a hemorrhoid in his life and suffered for months

Abbe Prizant Lang I know the feeling and I would much rather have an array of foods with fruits and veg, but I can’t at the moment as I’m dealing with gut issues. I appreciate you reaching out Abbe. Hopefully in a couple months I can have those too😊

I take magnesium every evening for sleep, leg cramps and digestion. If I take too much, I have loose stools. I got it figured out now. ☺️ But still only go about every 3 days vs. daily before carnivore.

Are you feeling like you need to go but can’t?
Your body uses up more of the food you eat when it’s so nutrient dense, so that can contribute. Eat more fat until stools are perfect. Less if loose and more if dry (which you don’t mention) Try the most … See more

Mag sounds like a good solution. Should help with sleep also. Would taking mag and some citrate be cheating?

I had this issue this week and realized I needed to lay off the liver. At least for the next few weeks until my body adjusts.
