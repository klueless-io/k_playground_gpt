Started 6 days ago and now when I go to the toilet itâ€™s all water out the back end! Is this normal?

Very normal for many! The rule is never trust a fart. Can take time for the gut to adapt. Decrease fat for now and slowly build up.

Completely normal.Some can have it for a day or two and others, like myself can have it for weeks. All normal. I'm now 7 months post starting carnivore and only ever get ðŸ’© when I have too much fat as my body soon tells me I've had too much ðŸ¤£

I had this for a week. In hindsight I would have experimented with reducing fat intake a bit. But keep at it. It will settle.
