Has anyone managed to find sugar free bacon at a normal supermarket? 
If not what is the best brand you have found with the lowest sugar?
Cheers

I didn't even know bacon had added sugar.

That one has dextrose and sugar. I've heard dextrose should also be avoided.

I buy the woolworths middle rashers from the fridge. From memory less than 1 gram per serve...

Sliced pork belly from the butcher is the best.
Just sprinkle w celtic salt + fry - totally yum!

Itâ€™s used in the curing process. Very minimal amount left.

Bev Bradley they actually use a fair bit during the curing but claim that there isnâ€™t much in the end product, but I can definitely taste it so I question there numbers.

Personally I'm more concerned about the % of Australian product that is in the bacon I buy. Some are less than 10% and that's probably just the sugar ðŸ˜€

You can soak it in water for a half an hour, but it will loose salt too.

I buy the cooking bacon from Aldi, 5.99 for 750 gms. Iâ€™m not worried about the sugar as it is minimal.
