I've been strict Carnivore for 3 weeks now and already feeling so much better. However, I'm really starting to miss wet food. By that I mean curry, bolagnese, chilli etc...anyone else felt/feeling this and any recommendations for substitutes?

You can make gravies with bone broth, beef gelatin, HWC, sour cream, cheese/cream cheese. Iâ€™m new to this, so I donâ€™t know if strict carnivore includes dairy. Unfortunately, my body doesnâ€™t handle dairy very well so I donâ€™t get to have gravies very often. ï¿¼

Christina Hartshorn Dr. Chaffee says that cheese can hinder your weight loss if that's your goal. I also don't handle dairy well. Would love a bowl of my killer chili right now!ðŸ˜†

Tyler Jones I seen this too, but itâ€™s funny Iâ€™ve been stuck for weeks at 209 lbs then ate a bunch of cheese the other night and woke up at 207 lbs

Well, I made chili which was nothing but stew meat, broth and seasonings. It cooked down but still soup. I added sour cream and cheese to the bowl. It thickened up a good bit.

Ground meat with bone broth, sour cream, cheddar cheese, spices if you tolerate.
I think someone on this page also made clam chowder with clams, heavy whipping cream, bacon and butter. It is SO good.

Sherry Lanning Franklin I made seafood chowder the other day with heavy whipping cream, butter, clams, mussels, Haddock, scallops, and crab, and it was delicious! Best chowder I ever made by keeping it carnivore

Thanks guys. Yeah, strict carnivore means no dairy so anything with cream or cheese is a no go. Maybe when I start to reintroduce stuff I can give that a nudge, but right now I'm eliminating to see what it is that my body doesn't like.

I make egg drop soup in beef bone broth very heavy on the egg. Season it with some good Celtic sea salt and my body literally craves it!

Blend beef tendon into your bone broth. It makes a thick creamy texture that is good for soups, stews and gravies.
