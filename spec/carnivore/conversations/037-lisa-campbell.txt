Hey guys, I am in need of a bit of encouragement. Day 59 of Carnivore,  I eased my way in, but been 100% compliant for 3 weeks. I am wanting to get off diabetes medication, feel better, and of course, lose weight. I need to lose at least 35kg  I started at 120kg and had the initial flush, of 5kg  but have been sitting at 115kg ever since. Yes I know I shouldn't believe the scales, my clothes feel a little looser, I have less inflammation, and havnt had any anti-inflamitories for over a week (yay). I can't say I have more energy, but I don't have less. Cravings have not been bad, and am generally enjoying what I have to eat. I guess I am just a bit disappointed that I havnt lost more weight. Cheer me on plz guys!! ðŸ¤¤

You are going great, you are healing on the inside, visceral fat is melting away from around your organs, your stomach microbiome is healing. There is a lot happening inside, that you probably don't realise. The weightloss will come, but more than thatâ€¦ See more

Not sure if you're eating dairy, but might be worth cutting it out. Also intermittent fast if you're not, it could help.

There is a womenâ€™s carnivore group where Iâ€™ve seen women post similar things and thereâ€™s plenty of advice and suggestions. As mentioned above, cutting out/down dairy is a common one. All the best!

It'll happen, that 5kgs is just water. Think how long it took to throw on that 35kg. Can't expect it to reverse overnight. Your body is too busy juggling everything with the change and adjusting. It'll start burning the visceral fat when it's satisfiedâ€¦ See more

Awesome job so far ðŸ˜Š there can be a number of reason while your holding at that weight. Hormones for women are usually the culprit. Morning sunlight, protein in the morning before coffee, magnesium, vitamin d and salt. And 8 hours of sleep with help regulate leptins

I started at 112 kg and I remember losing a bit of weight initially (which is the fluid, because attached to every glucose molecule is a molecule of water...which of course, is not really just water, but contains electrolytes and why we need to repleniâ€¦ See more

Don't rush it, your losing weight still gradually, just keep it simple, beef bacon eggs butter soda water for treats, black coffee, you can have milk but it stalls weight loss, be hard at the start to be easy at the finish, (SHEF) (start hard easy finiâ€¦ See more

Iâ€™m a couple of weeks behind you and find the numbers on the scales yo-yo a lot but the lower number continues to drop. If I donâ€™t maintain drinking plenty of water my weight loss will stall. Overall Iâ€™m feeling heaps better. I started at 110kg, sittinâ€¦ See more

Your body is still adapting to the changes. Reversing decades of unhealthy foods consumption takes time.Youâ€™ll find youâ€™ll lose weight without even trying you simply eat to satiety. As someone mentioned in an earlier comment maybe cut down on dairy proâ€¦ See more
