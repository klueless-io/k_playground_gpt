As you get healthier, they tend to go up. That‚Äôs exactly what I‚Äôve seen as well.
We should celebrate instead of worrying about high cholesterol. üòÇüòÇüòÇ
May be an image of 1 person and text that says 'Biggest Cholesterol Influencers When metabolically healthy and on low carb, ketogenic diet, these appear to have the biggest impact on cholesterol Overweight Body Fat Mildly Overweight Medium Lean Cholesterol Sedentary Energy Demands Light Moderate High cholesterol shaking your heads right now right scratching your heads okay'

Listen to Dr Paul mason and Dr Ken Berry on the topic of cholesterol. Good youtube info on the topic and on statins

Looks good but I'm no expert. Similar to my numbers though, everything high but the triglycerides which is the only one to worry about from what I've heard.

Tbh, look at trigs/HDL. Less than 1 is ideal ( they were better last year imo). Here is the thing tho, if your fasting was not within their range, then the numbers are out. If he is worried, do another test. The numbers change ( Dave Feldman showed he‚Ä¶ See more

Lisa Jules that should be in the sweet spot but try a shorter time. They may have typed it in wrong as well

Also they must look at cholesterol particle size, not just the levels. Big fluffy particles are good and small sneaky ones are bad.

You wouldn't be the first that has been told that. Funny thing is that doctors don't tell you that people that die from heart disease/attacks usually have low cholesterol levels not high levels....and the older you are it is actually better to have higher cholesterol!

I wouldn't even bother worrying about cholesterol levels before you first look at your inflammation markers.

Nothing to worry about. Lipid panels are a waste of time, no evidence to say they cause any disease

If you're lucky you might be able to talk your GP into getting you a free LDL subfraction analysis or a CAC scan, but more likely they'll just try to prescribe an LDL lowering drug

PS: The numbers for my bloods above were even higher in the previous test 2 years ago. "Hey look everybody, I lowered my cholesterol by 2!" üôÇ

I found this video very helpful, both for learning about the relevant (major) studies, but also for getting to sleep (or at least whiling away the hours while not sleepy) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyzkv5uFGt8

Trigs need to be 1.0 or less otherwise that high LDLs number becomes an issue. Over 1 often means carbs / sugar is still being consumed.

What they are worried about is heart disease not cholesterol disease. So check the heart. Get a referral for calcium score. It's a bit expensive but worth it as it actually checks the heart not a marker.

I bet he was itching to get you hooked on statins for life. No amount of bloodwork can inform of risk period.

Your triglycerides could be a little lower. But I also think that fasting before bloods can impact those numbers. Dr Kevin Stock (dentist) does a lot of bloods on himself and his site is a good read https://www.kevinstock.io/

My Dr told me I had a 98% chance of a heart attack when I saw her 8 weeks ago. My total was 9.6 but down to 8.6 now, she's going to give me 3 months to try getting it lower before wanting to put me on statins again

If you're concerned, get a CAC test, coronary arterial calcification score. It's by far the best indicator.
LDL can be high, but if CAC is low, you're completely fine.‚Ä¶ See more

Elijah Shervey Triglycerides need to 1 or under, if not there might be some concern about the LDL number.
