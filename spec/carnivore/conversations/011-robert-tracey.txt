Hi,
Curious to know what sort of butter people use for their steak. Seems like there is so many options to choose from, but just trying to find the best one.

Individual tastes ma friend. What one likes, another doesn't.
Personally through trial and error I prefer Westgold and President for a special treat.

As long as it's real butter, that's all that matters.

I use Westgold and Lurpak, i found them to be the best options in woollies near me. I felt Westgold was better but then noticed it has trans fat. So then I was like what the heck?... idk which one is healthiest. So I use both. I would like to try Pepe Saya butter.

I was using Westgold unsalted as i salt my meat beforehand .
Until I tried flooding it with tassie tallow, now it's tassie tallow for searing and heat flooding. Absolutely amazing.

I previously used butter or ghee butter ... now I just use homemade beef tallow ... best flavour by far for reversed seared steaks

For me, the best one is one that is pure butter with added salt then which is the cheaper of those ones.
