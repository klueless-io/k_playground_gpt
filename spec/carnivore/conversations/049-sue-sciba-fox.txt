I understand the health benefits of Carnivore, but I am so afraid it will be so monotonous and boring. Please share how you keep your meals diverse and appealing. BTW, I don‚Äôt eat organ cuts.

Eggs and bacon/sausage. Steak. Roast. Hamburger patties. Browned ground beef with extra butter. Carnivore casserole. And if you eat meat other than beef you‚Äôve got chicken varieties, pork chops‚Ä¶ Lots of yummy options.

Well, your assumption that we need food to entertain us with all sorts of colors or fancy stuff in all corners of the plate is wrong. You just don‚Äôt feel that way eating like this. But perhaps your understanding of just how many different kinds of mea‚Ä¶ See more

That‚Äôs understandable, but you need to do a mental shift to eating for nutrition rather eating for pleasure.
In the natural world before industrialization of the food supply, you could do both, because all of our food options were what was meant for ‚Ä¶ See more

Meat can never get boring. I can eat a steak every day for the rest of my life and be good.
For most of the people its just a learned mentality that you need to eat variety and "balanced" diet. Animals eat mostly same food in the wild. Cows eat same t‚Ä¶ See more

I think you will have to make a shift in your mindset. Technically we should eat to stay alive and be healthy. Unfortunately we have all strayed away from that and eat for taste and pleasure. It really depends on your goals and your whys. If your goals‚Ä¶ See more

Boring is the best part. Got so much free time from finding food, that i can awnser you. No eating is different, not even hungry as much. One or two meals a day.

Go to the butchers counter at the grocery store & take in the visual of the different cuts of meat. You can grill, bake or fry any of them with the seasonings of your liking! That's how I started!

Yeah I was worried about stopping smoking because I'd get bored, I believe it's the same for alcohol, crack and porn addiction...
That's what addiction does to people, makes you excited in anticipation and then you feel sick afterwards.

Many things in life are boring, but still good for me. So I find my entertainment and pleasure in other areas of my life. I do not use food as emotional regulation.

To be honest, after a while you just don‚Äôt care and the food bondage is broken and gone.
You eat for different reasons and the mental torment fades away.
Fairly quickly too because you feel and sleep so good.
