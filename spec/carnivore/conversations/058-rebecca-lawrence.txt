Isadora Moreira try biotrace elite (plain) - we used that for ages before switching to ancient lakes. We hike/bike pack so liquid was too tricky

None. Drink plenty of water, mineral water if you can, and cook everything in lots of saltâ€¦â€¦. And then add more salt ,ðŸ˜Š

I just use ancient lakes electrolyte salt on my food as I was new to this and wanted to avoid any side effects. Had no problems. Iâ€™m going to normal salt when it runs out.

I usually to add up to a teaspoon of Celtic Sea Salt to water I drink. Recently I packed LMNT electrolyte sachets to try while I was away on holiday. They were delicious and sugar free.

Did you take electrolytes prior to starting carnivore lifestyle and how long have you been carnivore.
I ask because when initially starting your body will deplete some glycogen stored in muscles and when it does, you loose water which will flush some â€¦ See more

David Anderson I've been thinking of taking an all in one sachet like LMNT. I already have plenty of salt on my food. I guess the main concerns are potassium, magnesium and salt?
