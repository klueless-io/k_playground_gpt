Looks like my body is forcing me to give up coffee! I keep forgetting to have a second cup, which leads me to sleep better that night, which leads me to not need a second cup of coffee the next day!
It looks as though the only reason people NEED coffee is to compensate for their terrible diet --- which saps them of energy and forces them to compensate in some way. But a proper diet puts everything in a proper alignment. Over time, of course.

My coffee intake has naturally reduced too. Often now if I do make a second one I end up putting it down and forgetting about it. I've gone from 5+ coffees a day to only 1, maybe 2 but only if I'm meeting someone for coffee.

Yes after a month on carni I wasn't as obsessed to get my first cup of the day and then after I ditched all dairy I lost ALL interest in caffeine. Then I started reading how bad caffeine is for slow metabolisers and I'm sold.

Coffee is an addictive substance that the MSM has decided is ok. No ones NEEDS coffee they are just told it's a part of life

I love Coffee. The coffee smell of freshly ground beans is beautiful first thing in the morning. My only vice. So I will never give it up.
But I do drink the best Decaf Swiss Water I can find. Not supermarket rubbish.

I watched a video of stake, butter and eggs girl on YouTube and she was saying how she has gone off coffee, because after having breakfast than coffee it doesn't taste as nice any more...
