Why does diarrhoea happen on the first stages of carnivore?

Your body needs to adjust to processing the higher fat content of the diet. Also if your gut flora may be poor due to eating processed crap food.

When you move into ketosis your body drops fluid it normally holds to metabolise carbs.

Because you eliminate fibre. It's cement that binds thing up. Also all the above re adjustment to gut bacteria

Hi Isadora! I had about 6 weeks of the terrible D when I started back in Feb 2023. This was not like the first time I tried carnivore a few years earlier, where I had little D and really nice stools. This time around I was sicker and my gall bladder wa‚Ä¶ See more

Michael Hoffman how did you know the your gallbladder has flushed itself? I wanted it to flush it using a cleanse, but would he interested if carnivore can actually do the same thing

Andy Ledesma I recall now that I was aware that as I ate more and more fat - and I as CRAVING so much fat beforehand, this is forcing the GB to work - to squeeze out juice over and over like it hasn't done for years and years. It would not surprise me ‚Ä¶ See more

Michael Hoffman apologies for typos on my previous posts, but you understood what i meant. I agree with your theory 100%. I was already running on the assumption myself that the bile stored in GB is being used to digest the fats we eat, so when we eat ‚Ä¶ See more

Hi Andy - I cannot tell you 100% for sure that's what happened, only that the amount of retched, stinking, rancid bile-smelling cr@p water that came out of me over a 5 day period had to be experienced to be understood. After that my metabolism settled ‚Ä¶ See more

Michael Hoffman same thoughts mate. I try to avoid the drs for now at least, as most would just tell us to pop a pill instead of naturally allowing our body to heal by correcting our diet. All the best!

So, to answer your question, and I'm no expert, there is the phenomenon of dropping all that water that carbs holds in our bodies, taking valuable electrolytes with it, but this is only for a week or so. The rest of the time it takes your body to produ‚Ä¶ See more

The worst part is that the fat in the D sets on contact with the bowl and won't flush! Ewww, sorry üò£üò£

Dunno. Doesn‚Äôt kill ya. First of all, you sort of oscillate out of it by being good and then D and good again. Eventually, you‚Äôre mostly good with the occasional D. that‚Äôs me after a year.

Your current gut flora can't deal well with a sudden move to carnivore and need to change to those that favour a carnivore diet..

Not releasing enough bile into the intestines to deal with the fat. Takes a while for your body to adjust. Adding some bile salts with your meal will help deal with this during the transition.

Oxalate dumping. And gut biome changing. It took me almost 6 months to get somewhat normal.. it ain't for the faint of heart this way of eating. But it's the main stream that's poisoned us all our whole lives .. so that's alot of detox... The oxalate‚Ä¶ See more

Didn't for me. I went low carb first. I'd say microbiome adjustment.

I think my gallbladder was a bit stuffed from all the low fat eating I had done previously.
Figured out pork was not good as too high in fat compared to steak. Got better after a couple of weeks and only after about 12 months could eat fatty pork no pr‚Ä¶ See more

May be an image of text that says 'The microorganisms in your gut will start to die off and give way to the microorganisms that thrive on animal foods. The change in the microorganisms can change the gut composition and cause discomfort in the digestive tract. One of its symptoms is diarrhea. Overall, diarrhea is a sign your gut is resetting. 4 July 2023 https://carnivorestyle.com Blog Carnivore Diet Diarrhea (Main Causes & Solutions)'

Its something to do with fibre and your body's way of expelling water. When you stop eating fibre your body has to adjust and it that time you get diahorrea.
