Hi guys (and girls), I purchased a large Sunbeam slow-cooker this week and the first thing (so far) I've cooked in it was a lamb half-leg roast from Coles. 
I cooked it for 6 hours on 'low' and then left it for a further 2 hours on 'keep warm.' When I had some yesterday, and again today, it was cooked fully but no better than if I had cooked it covered in the oven for 6 hours - cooked but not tender.
Am I able to cook it in the slow-cooker until it is literally falling off the bone, and if I can, for how long does it need to be cooked? TIA.
ETA - my next try was a 2kg rolled pork roast. I put it in and only added a glass of red wine, and cooked on low for 10 hours overnight. It literally fell apart and tasted wonderful - for the next 3 days, lol.
Thanks everyone, for all the advice, much appreciated.

I leave my meat in for as long as I can, sometimes up to 12hrs. I check after 8 hrs to see how it's going.

First use high setting, then when that is happening put it on low, definitely not warm. Keep it on low overnight and in the morning... voila, best brekkie ever ðŸ™‚ Lamb is by far my fave.
Meat will be falling off the bones.

I agree with Lindeâ€™s comment - try for up to 12 hours. When I cook a lamb shoulder roast, I turn it on around 7.30am on low and eat it at around 6.30pm.

I use my slow cooker all the time. I always do 6 hours on high. Buttery soft and never had a fail yet. I do all sorts of meat.

6 hours on high has worked well for me. Made wallaby broth last time with tallow and salt, turned out rich as.

We've only done beef so far but used two different cuts. One was perfect to shred up after about 8 hrs on low, the other needed an extra hr or so.

Laura Everitt I'm planning on doing a 1.5kg brisket in the next day or so - was that one that you've tried?

we did a leg of lamb a week ago on low for about 8-9hrs. It was preboned but should work for your purpose.
Edit - it came apart like pulled pork

I prefer lamb shoulder for slow cooking. It remains moist & buttery even once it begins to fall off the bone.
I like lamb leg better for roasting hot & fast just until it reaches the required interior temperature and not a moment longer. It doesn't haâ€¦ See more

Mitch Molloy Agreed, I prefer lamb shoulder much more - which was probably why I only had a leg of lamb in the freezer to try with ðŸ™‚

Yeah I agree 8-12 hours. I get up early and put it on 5-6am on high for roughly an hour to bring it up to temp then leave it on low the whole day. Ready at dinner time. That's for lamb shanks but it would be no different. Sometimes over night. I also sâ€¦ See more

Season meat and add 1 litre of beef stock to cook it in for 8 hours on low and the meat will just fall off the bone, try not to open the lid too often.

4 hours on high, then turn it to low until your ready to serve.

Put it on high. The low does next to nothing.

Thereâ€™s nothing really special about a slow cooker, until I had one Iâ€™d put meat in the camp oven the in the oven at about 100 for 8 hours or so.
Advantage with the slow cooker is that it frees up the oven for other things.
I generally cook briskets, aâ€¦ See more

I put it on when i get to it in the morning on low and itâ€™s always perfect falling off the bone when we eat, I have 4 slow cookers and find the cheap one always chewier than the high quality, seems $$ make all the difference in this case

Are you adding liquid? How lean is it? 8hrs should be falling off bone.
