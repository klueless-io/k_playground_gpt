Depends on how bad your diet was to start with and for how long. The more insulin resistant you are, the longer it takes.

Replace it with eating eggs, that's what I did and it's so good! Even my friends preferred it.

I’m on day 10 now, I get it. I’ve had a brown butter bite at the time of craving and it’s helped
