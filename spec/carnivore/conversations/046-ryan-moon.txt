When you can just change your diet without having to make it consume your life and act like you are in a cult while judging and loathing the rest of society that doesn‚Äôt eat what you do!!

Wayne Fuqua That's why I absolutely love this group it's so laid back nobody judges anyone here. No carnivore police in any way shape or form.

It means you mostly only eat meat but are relaxed about certain aspects or foods which work for you at the time.

Judy Prazmark Mathena-Fishell yes on the 1-3 days we allow other things, but 4-6 days a week we are strict carnivore only. It keeps us from getting bored and it works for us, it's keeps our body guessing a bit and blood work is excellent.

I would think to start out, you should start full carnivore. Then as you heal and lose the weight, begin adding one item at a time to see if you have any type of reaction to it . If u do, don't eat it.

Carnivore diet is claimed to be healthy diet for some and other say the opposite.
In my opinion, you should give it a try and see for yourself.

Cheese, heavy cream, sour cream, spices, ECT. Carnivore is if it has eyes. Relaxed is if it came from something with eyes.
