How do you know if the meat is injected with water?
Iâ€™ve been buying beef cuts and lamb at aldi, and it shrinks too much when cooked.

I got a few private kills off farms lately and the difference in meat quality is night and day...I didn't realise how crap supermarket meat really is until now.

Dave Forbes is it a comparison between grass and grain fed or just purely the quality of meat from supermarket and direct from farmers?

Andy Ledesma idk what they do to it between the farm and the shop but it's garbage when it gets there...maybe just not fresh for the most part...

Beef and lamb in Australia are not injected with water. Its likely a consequence of poor water holding capacity and could be caused by a number of things most likely a poor pH decline which is why it is sold at Aldi and not Woolies, Coles or a butcher â€¦ See more

Supermarket meat isn't hung for long enough to reduce the water in it, unlike butcher's meat. Dry age it yourself and it'll be fine.

Jimmy James so true. Killed one day and boned out and sliced within 3 days.

Most supermarket meats are. You need to dry age them for a couple of days

I take it home, wash, wrap in a old clean towel and leave it in the fridge for a few days then slice. Dry as.

We switched to buying bulk organic meat from local butchers. Organic beef - $24.99/kg. It doesn't shrink like standard supermarket meat.
There's quite a few butchers who offer this ðŸ˜Š

It's actually against the law to pump with water unless it's corned beef, ham or moisture infused pork. It is the gas flush process in the packaged meat that is causing this.
