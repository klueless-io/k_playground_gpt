Hello, I finally started this woe after a lot of research. Iv been going strong for a week and a half now and feel fine, but, I can’t stand eggs and also, the thought of organ meat turns my stomach lol. My diet has consisted of beef, pork,  seafood, cheese, and water.. with that said, and considering I feel fine, should I be worried about not eating the eggs and organ meat?         TIA

This may not be everybody's cup of tea, but what I do is I swallow one raw egg yolk and 10 grams of raw liver a day. Must be good quality though. However, a lot of people don't eat organ meat and eggs on this diet and it's fine. It's definitely not a dealbreaker!

Just eat what you can now. Maybe add eggs in a different form like baked with bacon and some cheese.

From what I’ve heard, if you keep trying liver you will actually learn to like it. Maybe the same could be said for eggs. I know I only like eggs with salt, so maybe trying different seasons or cooking methods will help you appreciate them more.

The egg is the most versatile food ever. Turn it into something you like.

Carnivore Cop I’m not much of a cook haha. I can figure something out to disguise ￼the taste if need be, but how critical is it that I have that in my diet?

John Cook Not critical but I love noodles bread pizza waffles buns etc.. If I can watch a YouTube video and copy a recipe so I can have those things too, I'm gonna do it. As.good as steak is, it's not what in want 24-7.

Some people can’t do eggs and don’t eat liver. They do just fine.
