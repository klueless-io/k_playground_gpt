Any recommendations for beef tallow skin cream? My skin is getting a bit dry and flaky.

Tallow butter from Tassie tallow works well

Sergio Ra like tallow, but very mild, you only need a very small amount, nobody would smell it on you

I second ecology. Nice scents. You can buy small trial size pots to see what you like.

Might need to eat a bit more fat? Not sure, but I've read that helps.

Tassie Tallow makes it, but the one I tried smelled more beefy than I'd like for my face. Ecology Skincare make a range which all smell lovely, variety of masculine, floral and neutral scents.

To me, Ecology scents are quite strong, though there is an emu oil/olive oil mixture one, which isn‚Äôt as strong in smell. The mixture is extremely smooth. Good as a perfume if going out‚Ä¶it‚Äôs that strong.
Tassie Tallows aren‚Äôt as strong in scent as Ec‚Ä¶ See more

Tuttofare is great, it does get a bit lumpy in winter.
Ecology is also good. Much smoother in winter than Tottofare.
As for the effect on the skin, I like them both.

Buy any edible beef tallow from the shops and mix with your usual face moisturiser. Did this for any rash or inflammations and definitely reduced and soothed the skin.

Buy or make tallow, heat it to its liquid form, then cool in the fridge until white again but not firm. Whip it with an electric beater - if you like, add some essential oils such as frankincense, geranium rose or lavender before whipping. That's it!

Just rub a tiny bit of tallow on dry skin. Why add stupid plants? $$$
if I cut myself, I will put tallow on the wound and it helps heal away from the air.

Eat more fat and drink more water. Try some bone broth homemade as well.

When I'm out of tallow moisturizer, just be rubbing fat off cuts on my skin. Surprising how easy the fat melt with body heat. Meeting lots of friendly dogs lately ü§î
