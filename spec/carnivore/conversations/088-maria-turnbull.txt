Appetite question.
Ive been carnivore for a couple years, keto before that.
I‚Äôve tried high fat/mod - low protein and high protein / low- mod fat.
My appetite the last 4-5 months has been off the show!!! 
Anyone else experienced this..??
I can easily eat 1.5kg plus of mince a day. I‚Äôve tried fasting to reset. I wake up in the middle of the night hungry sometimes even though I ate dinner.
Just seems so odd‚Ä¶.

Maya Barker Im wondering if its hormones too but really hoping not as a bit too young for peri-menopause.
I‚Äôve been getting a lot of muscles cramps too, in my entire body. Eat enough salt and have electrolytes.
Its just crazy. Im worried all this meat ‚Ä¶ See more

Maria Turnbull Theirs your problem I find when I eat other minced meats and chicken I am less satiated, whole cuts of beef especially steaks tougher cuts like bolar blades briskets etc sustain me longer.

Me too.. carni a couple of years and keto prior.. I am hungry now too, and have moved to 3 meals a day.. maybe metabolism is healing after restricting calories on and off for years? Here's hoping anyway

Listen to Dr Anthony Chaffee‚Äôs recent q&a podcast. He talks about increased appetite on long term carnivore. Short answer it is common. I am 10 months in and am eating a lot more now than when I started. My body composition is changing but no weight increase.
