For those of you who have progressed to follow a strict Lion Diet..
Did you find more benefits from this woe? I know it is specifically for healing, but weight loss is also a goal for me. 
Did you lose more weight? Faster? Any other symptoms reduced?

Going lion was a game changer for me, when you heal, you often lose weight faster. Healed histamine intolerence with really bad symptoms and auto immune issues are symptomless...been 8 months on lion. I recently added butter back in, I just do better â€¦ See more

Yes. CV lost approx 1kg per 8 wks. LD lost 1kg per week for 9+ mths and I believe my healing was also quicker and deeper

I've lost about 1 kilo per week for the past 5 weeks, but weight loss is not my goal. The reduced inflammation, my energy and mental alertness is what I'm most thrilled about. My skin has cleared up. My breathing has improved. I'm sleeping way better. â€¦ See more

May be an image of text that says 'People also ask What is the lion diet? The Lion Diet involves consuming only water, salt, and meat from ruminant animals, which includes cows, deer, and sheep (beef, venison, and lamb/mutton), as well as bison and goats. 22 May 2023'
