I would recommend A2 Milk (you can google, what exactly that is). I drink this every day and have no problems with it. Also, if he's really craving it, it could also be a hint on a deficiency in calcium.

Genetically we are designed to become intolerant to milk lactose somewhere between the ages of 5 and 20. People of Northern European descent developed a genetic mutation around 800 years ago that meant they could continue to tolerate lactose. So given ‚Ä¶ See more

May stall weight loss if he drinks too much. Best to find a small farm and get it raw.

its not considered carnivore, but at the end of the day, it probably wont hurt. I know several people that cycle on and off and are like 95% carnivore. If he does use it as close as he can get to the cow is best, like raw non pasturized

Yes. I find when I'm craving that I didn't eat enough beef or fat. Once I do it stops the cravings.

I get my son Fairlife whole milk, it has 50% more protein and 50% less sugar than regular milk plus lactose free. Only gripe with this brand is I've not been able to find it organic. My son's lost almost 30# since June 1st just diet alone, no gym.
