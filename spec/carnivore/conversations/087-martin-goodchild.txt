I do 30 g fat to 100 g red meat weighed raw then cooked. Pour rendered fat back over food, sometimes it‚Äôs a bit rich and I don‚Äôt use all the rendered. And of course if it‚Äôs a fatty meat then the added fat can be reduced.

Im not adding additional fat anymore as I put on some weight. Dr Anthony Chaffee told me to just eat fatty meats.

The fat in the meat is plenty under 1kg meat for weight loss over 1kg for muscle development (aka gains)
