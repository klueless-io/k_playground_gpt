Hi
Thank you for accepting me into your group. Iâ€™m new to carnivore and have been eating this way for about two weeks. Today after sitting down all day at a conference I got a massive leg cramp in my right leg. Iâ€™ve never had such a painful crap in my life. Iâ€™ve only been only taking magnesium tablets for the last two or three days and wondered if this is cramping is normal. Any suggestions of overcoming this would be greatly appreciated. Iâ€™m enjoying the way of eating and already lost between four and 5 kg.ï¿¼

Some magnesium tablets arent real good. Either magnesium oil spray or electrolyte supplements such as LMNT or Sodii are worth a try.

It's possibly related to sodium deficiency.
