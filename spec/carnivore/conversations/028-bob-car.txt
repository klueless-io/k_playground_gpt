Talk me through the weight loss stall. 15 pounds off the first 2 weeks, nothing much since, now end of 4th week. No cheating, in fact, I cut out dairy. Steaks, butter, eggs, salt, seafood, mostly crab. Thoughts? Encouragement? I had hoped the scale would keep moving.

Sheila Peralta, not counting calories. One meal a day, maybe two, depending on hunger.

Anonymous participant At the end of the day weight loss is calories in vs calories out. So, maybe your intake is equal to your output. Can you add some activity to your day?

Sheila Peralta this has been proven to be oversimplified. Undereating will prevent weight loss. And the human body is an open system, not a closed one.

Weight stalls are normal. This is my journey since January. Ive now lost almost 50lbs. Got off to a great start but overall lost nothing during march. You just have to believe in the process

Sheila Peralta if everyone tracked their weight loss like we do then it becomes very clear that weight loss is never linear and its a far more complex process than just eat less to lose weight. There is so much more going on. What i have found is that … See more

I have heard that this diet can make your bones more dense. So therefore it will look like you're not losing weight. Just keep that in mind.

Anita Khin I don't think it was something stress upon. Like a main subject. It was talking about weight loss and how people. Think they are at a weight stall. But the doctor had said it could be bone density happening. I can't pinpoint which podcast it… See more

Not about calories. If you don’t eat enough your body compensates thinking there’s a famine. Eat until you can’t eat another bite. Then only eat when hungry. Absolutely never go hungry or finish eating before full. Stick to Ribeye steak only and drink only water.
